The parameters $m$, $\\gamma$, and $\\omega_0$ are all positive real numbers.

These depend on the damping parameter $\\gamma$ and the natural frequency $\\omega_0$. The left plot in Fig. 2 shows how $\\omega_\\pm$ varies with $\\gamma$, with $\\omega_0$ fixed.  For $\\gamma = 0$ (zero damping), the two frequencies have real values $\\pm \\omega_0$; this corresponds to undamped (or \"simple\") harmonic oscillation at the oscillator's natural frequency.  If we increase $\\gamma$, both $\\omega_+$ and $\\omega_-$ move downwards in the complex plane; because the imaginary part of the frequencies are negative, this implies damped oscillation.  (In fact, one can show that the complex trajectories are exactly semi-circular.)  At $\\gamma = \\omega_0$, the frequencies meet at a \"critical point\" $\\omega = -i\\omega_0$, which lies on the imaginary axis.  As $\\gamma$ increases further, the two frequencies move away from the critical point, along the imaginary axis; because the frequencies are purely imaginary, these solutions just decay without oscillating (we'll say more about this [[#Over-damped motion|shortly]]).\n",

For $\\omega_0 = 0$ (vanishing restoring force), the two frequencies lie on the imaginary axis, at $\\omega_+ = 0$ and $\\omega_- = -2i\\gamma$.  Upon increasing $\\omega_0$, the two frequencies approach each other along the imaginary axis, and meet at the critical point. As $\\omega_0$ is increased past the critical point, oscillation sets in and the two frequencies acquire equal and opposite real parts."

It has a straightforward physical interpretation: in the \"over-damped\" regime, the motion of the oscillator is dominated by the damping force rather than the spring force, so as the oscillator tries to return to its equilibrium position $x = 0$, the damping acts against this motion.  Hence, the stronger the damping, the slower the decay to equilibrium.\n",
