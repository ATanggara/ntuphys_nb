\section{Complex Oscillations}
\label{complex-oscillations}

The most common use of complex numbers in physics is for analyzing
oscillations and waves. We will illustrate this with a simple but
crucially important model, the \textbf{damped harmonic oscillator}.

\subsection{The damped harmonic oscillator}
\label{the-damped-harmonic-oscillator}

Consider a particle of mass $m$, subject to a spring force and a
damping force. The particle can move along one dimension, and we let
$x(t)$ denote its displacement from the origin. The damping
coefficient is $2m \gamma$, and the spring constant is
$k = m\omega_0^2$. The parameters $m$, $\gamma$, and $\omega_0$
are all positive real numbers.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{oscillator}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The motion of the particle is described by Newton's second law:
\begin{equation}
m \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = F(x,t) = - 2m\gamma \frac{dx}{dt} - m\omega_0^2 x(t).
\end{equation}
Dividing by the common factor of $m$, and bringing everything to one
side, gives
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} + 2\gamma \frac{dx}{dt} + \omega_0^2 x(t) = 0.
\end{equation}
We call this ordinary differential equation the \textbf{damped harmonic
oscillator equation}.

\begin{framed} \noindent
  \textit{Note}---Sometimes, we write the damped harmonic oscillator
  equation a bit differently:
  \begin{equation*}
    \left[\frac{d^2}{dt^2} + 2\gamma \frac{d}{dt} + \omega_0^2 \right]\, x(t) = 0.
  \end{equation*}
  The quantity in the square brackets is regarded as an operator
  acting on $x(t)$. This operator consists of the sum of three terms:
  a second-derivative operator, a constant times a first derivative,
  and multiplication by a constant.
\end{framed}

\subsubsection{Behavior of the solution}
\label{behavior-of-the-solution}

The damped harmonic oscillator equation is a second-order ordinary
differential equation (ODE), which means that the general solution
must contain two free parameters.  These independent parameters are
sometimes (but not always) expressed in terms of the initial
displacement $x(0)$ and initial velocity $\dot{x}(0)$.

For $\gamma = 0$ (zero damping), the system reduces to the
\textbf{simple harmonic oscillator}. From previous physics courses, we
know that the general solution to the simple harmonic oscillator has the
form
\begin{equation}
x(t) = A \cos(\omega_0 t + \phi),
\end{equation}
where $A$ and $\phi$ are free parameters. This describes a
sinusoidal motion with constant amplitude $A$, phase $\phi$, and
angular frequency $\omega_0$. Note, by the way, that this points to
the reason we chose to express the spring constant as
$k = m\omega_0^2$: the quantity $\omega_0$ is called the
\textbf{natural frequency of oscillation}, i.e., the angular frequency
of the oscillator in the absence of damping.

Incidentally, the general solution to the simple harmonic oscillator can
also be expressed in terms of the initial displacement $x(0) = x_0$
and initial velocity $\dot{x}(0) = v_0$. It is straightforward to show
that
\begin{equation}
A = \sqrt{x_0^2 + \left(\frac{v_0}{\omega_0}\right)^2}, \quad \phi = -\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{v_0}{\omega_0 x_0}\right).
\end{equation}
Now consider $\gamma > 0$. Based on physical intuition, we expect that
the particle still wants to oscillate around the equilibrium position,
$x = 0$, due to the spring force. However, the damping force now acts
opposite to the direction of motion, and does work against the
particle.  Hence, the particle loses energy over time; as $t
\rightarrow \infty$, both $x$ and $\dot{x}$ should go to zero.  A
typical solution is shown in the figure below:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{damped_oscillator_motion}
\end{figure}
            
\subsection{Complex solution}\label{complex-solution}

The variable $x(t)$ stands for the displacement of a particle, which
is a real quantity. But in order to solve the damped harmonic oscillator
equation, it's useful to generalize $x(t)$ to complex values. In other
words, we will treat the harmonic oscillator equation as a
\emph{complex} ODE:

\begin{framed}
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{d^2 z}{dt^2} + 2\gamma \frac{dz}{dt} + \omega_0^2 z(t) = 0, \quad z(t) \in \mathbb{C}.
  \end{equation}
\end{framed}

The parameter-counting rule for real ODEs also applies to complex
ODEs, except that the parameters are complex numbers. In this case,
the complex damped harmonic oscillator equation is a second-order ODE,
so its general solution should contain two \emph{complex} free
parameters.

Once we have a general solution to the complex problem, we can get the
solution for the real problem by doing one of two things:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Plug in a complete set of (real) boundary conditions, which will
  give a \emph{real} specific solution, or

\item
  Take the real part of the complex general solution, which will give
  the general solution to the \emph{real} differential equation.
\end{enumerate}
We will discuss these two approaches later; for the moment, let's focus
on finding the solution to the complex ODE.

\subsubsection{Complex ansatz}\label{complex-ansatz}

First of all, note that the damped harmonic oscillator equation is
linear. This means that if we have two solutions $z_1(t)$ and
$z_2(t)$, then any combination
\begin{equation}
a_1 \, z_1(t) + a_2 \,z_2(t),\quad \mathrm{where}\;\; a_1, a_2 \in \mathbb{C}
\end{equation}
is also a solution. Therefore, a good strategy is to find several
specific solutions, and then combine them to form a more general
solution.

We simply make a guess (or an \textbf{ansatz}) for a specific solution:
\begin{equation}
z(t) = e^{-i\omega t}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\omega$ is a constant to be determined (which could be
complex). The first and second derivatives are:
\begin{align}
  \frac{dz}{dt} &= -i\omega\, e^{-i\omega t} \\ \frac{d^2z}{dt^2} &= -\omega^2\, e^{-i\omega t}
\end{align}
Substituting these into the differential equation gives:
\begin{equation}
\left[-\omega^2 - 2i\gamma \omega + \omega_0^2 \right] e^{-i\omega t} = 0.
\end{equation}
This equation can be satisfied for all $t$ if the complex second-order
polynomial on the left-hand side is zero:
\begin{equation}
-\omega^2 - 2i\gamma \omega + \omega_0^2 = 0.
\end{equation}
In other words, we need values of $\omega$ which solve this quadratic
equation. The solutions can be obtained from the quadratic formula:
\begin{equation}
\omega = -i\gamma \pm \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}.
\end{equation}
Hence, we arrive at solutions which are oscillations with \emph{complex}
frequencies:
\begin{equation}
z(t) = \exp\big(-i\omega_\pm t\big), \;\;\mathrm{where}\;\; \omega_\pm = -i\gamma \pm \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}.
\end{equation}
For each value of $\gamma$ and $\omega_0$, there are two possible
frequencies, $\omega_+$ and $\omega_-$. For either choice of complex
frequency, the above expression for $z(t)$ gives a valid specific
solution for the complex damped harmonic oscillator equation.

\subsubsection{Complex frequencies} \label{complex-frequencies}

What does it mean to have an oscillation with a complex frequency? If we
write the real and imaginary parts of the frequency as
$\omega = \omega_R + i \omega_I$, then
\begin{equation}
z(t) = e^{-i\omega t} = e^{\omega_I t} \; e^{-i\omega_R t}.
\end{equation}
If both $\omega_R$ and $\omega_I$ are non-zero, this describes a
spiral trajectory in the complex plane, whose magnitude is either
increasing or decreasing with time, depending on the sign of
$\omega_O$. This is because we can write
\begin{equation}
z(t) = e^{\omega_I t} \; e^{-i\omega_R t} = R(t)\, e^{i\theta(t)}, \;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;R(t) = e^{\omega_I t}, \; \theta(t) = -\omega_R t.
\end{equation}
We therefore conclude that the real part of $\omega$ determines the
(angular) frequency of oscillation, whereas the imaginary part
determines whether the oscillation amplitude is either growing with time
(amplification) or shrinking with time (damping). A positive imaginary
part implies amplification, and a negative imaginary part implies
damping, while zero imaginary part (i.e., a real frequency) implies
constant-amplitude oscillation.

Now let's look at the damped harmonic oscillator's complex
frequencies,
\begin{equation}
\omega_\pm = -i\gamma \pm \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}.
\end{equation}
These depend on two real parameters: $\gamma$ and $\omega_0$. In the
plot below, you can see how the position of $\omega_\pm$ in the
complex plane depends on the values of these parameters.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{oscillator_frequencies}
\end{figure}

\noindent
In particular, note the following features:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  For $\gamma = 0$ (zero damping), the two frequencies are both real,
  and take the values $\pm \omega_0$. This corresponds to simple
  harmonic oscillation at the oscillator's natural frequency.
\item
  If we increase $\gamma$ from zero with $\omega_0$ fixed, both
  $\omega_+$ and $\omega_-$ move downwards in the complex plane,
  along a circular arc. Because the imaginary part of the frequencies
  are negative, this implies that the particle undergoes damped
  oscillation. This is called \textbf{under-damped motion}.

\item
  At $\gamma = \omega_0$, the frequencies meet on the imaginary
  axis. This is a special case called \textbf{critical damping}.

\item
  For $\gamma > \omega_0$, the two frequencies move apart along the
  imaginary axis. Purely imaginary frequencies correspond to a
  trajectory that simply decays without oscillating. This is called
  \textbf{over-damped motion}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{General solution for the damped harmonic oscillator}
\label{general-solution-for-the-damped-harmonic-oscillator}

For now, suppose $\omega_0 \ne \gamma$. In the previous section, we
found two classes of specific solutions, with complex frequencies
$\omega_+$ and $\omega_-$:
\begin{equation}
z_+(t) = e^{-i\omega_+ t} \;\;\mathrm{and}\;\; z_-(t) = e^{-i\omega_- t}, \;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;\; \omega_\pm = -i\gamma \pm \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}.
\end{equation}
We can write down a more general solution consisting of a linear
superposition of these specific solutions:
\begin{align}
  z(t) &= \psi_+ e^{-i\omega_+ t} + \psi_- e^{-i\omega_- t}
  \label{gensol} \\
  &= \psi_+ \, \exp\left[\left(-\gamma  - i \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}\right)t\right] \; +\; \psi_- \, \exp\left[\left(-\gamma +i\sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}\right)t\right].
\end{align}
This contains two undetermined complex parameters, $\psi_+$ and
$\psi_-$. These are \emph{independent} parameters since they are the
coefficients that multiply different functions (the functions are
different because $\omega_0 \ne \gamma$ implies that
$\omega_+ \ne \omega_-$). Hence, the above equation for $z(t)$ is a
general solution for the complex damped harmonic oscillator equation.

To obtain the general solution to the \emph{real} damped harmonic
oscillator equation, we have to take the real part of the complex
solution. The result can be further simplified depending on whether
$\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2$ is positive or negative. This leads to what
are called \textbf{under-damped solutions} and \textbf{over-damped
solutions}, to be discussed in the following subsections.

What about if $\omega_0 = \gamma$? In this instance, $\omega_+ =
\omega_-$, which means that $\psi_+$ and $\psi_-$ aren't independent
parameters. Therefore, the above equation for $z(t)$ isn't a valid
general solution in this particular case!  We will discuss how to
handle this case in Section~\ref{critical-damping}.

\subsubsection{Under-damped motion}\label{under-damped-motion}

For $\omega_0 > \gamma$, let us define, for convenience,
\begin{equation}
\Omega = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}.
\end{equation}
Then we can simplify the real solution as follows:
\begin{align}
  x(t) &= \mathrm{Re}\left[z(t)\right] \\ &= e^{-\gamma t} \; \mathrm{Re}\left[\psi_+ \, e^{-i \Omega t} \,+\, \psi_- \, e^{i\Omega t}\right] \\ &= e^{-\gamma t} \left[ A\cos\left(\Omega t\right) + B \sin\left(\Omega t\right)\right], \;\;\mathrm{where}\;\; A, B \in \mathbb{R}
\end{align}
With a bit of algebra, we can show that
\begin{equation}
A = \mathrm{Re}\left[\psi_+ + \psi_-\right], \quad B = \mathrm{Im}\left[\psi_+ - \psi_-\right].
\end{equation}
The coefficients $A$ and $B$ act as two independent \emph{real}
parameters, so this is a valid general solution for the real damped
harmonic oscillator equation. Using the trigonometric formulas, the
solution can be equivalently written as
\begin{equation}
x(t) = C e^{-\gamma t} \cos\left[\Omega t + \Phi\right],
\end{equation}
with the parameters $C = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2}$ and
$\Phi = - \tan^{-1}\left[B/A\right]$.

Either way, this is called an \textbf{under-damped solution}. As shown
below, the trajectory is an oscillation whose amplitude decreases with
time. The decrease in the amplitude can be visualized using a smooth
``envelope'' given by $\pm C e^{-\gamma t}$, which is drawn with
dashes in the figure. Inside this envelope, the trajectory oscillates
with frequency $\Omega = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}$, which is
slightly less than the natural frequency of oscillation $\omega_0$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{underdamped}
\end{figure}
   
\subsubsection{Over-damped motion}\label{over-damped-motion}

For $\omega_0 < \gamma$, the square root term becomes imaginary. It is
convenient to define
\begin{equation}
\Gamma = \sqrt{\gamma^2 - \omega_0^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2} = i \Gamma.
\end{equation}
Then the real solution simplifies in a different way:
\begin{align}
  x(t) &= \mathrm{Re}\left[z(t)\right] \\&= \mathrm{Re}\left[\psi_+ e^{\left(-\gamma  + \Gamma\right)t} + \psi_- e^{\left(-\gamma - \Gamma\right)t} \right] \\ &= C_+ e^{-(\gamma - \Gamma) t} + C_- e^{-(\gamma + \Gamma) t},
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
C_\pm = \mathrm{Re}[\psi_\pm].
\end{equation}
This is called an \textbf{over-damped} solution. The solution consists
of two terms, both exponentially decaying in time, with
$(\gamma-\Gamma)$ and $(\gamma + \Gamma)$ serving as the decay
rates. Note that both decay rates are positive real numbers, because
$\Gamma < \gamma$ from the definition of $\Gamma$. Also, note that
the first decay rate $(\gamma - \Gamma)$ is a \emph{decreasing}
function of $\gamma$, whereas the second decay rate
$(\gamma + \Gamma)$ is an \emph{increasing} function of $\gamma$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{overdamped}
\end{figure}

    
    
    The larger decay rate, $(\gamma + \Gamma)$, is associated with a
faster-decaying exponential. Therefore, at long times the second term
becomes negligible compared to the first term. Then the solution
approaches the limit
\begin{equation}
x(t) \approx C_+ e^{-(\gamma - \Gamma) t} \qquad (\mathrm{large}\;\;t).
\end{equation}
This limiting curve is shown as a red dash in the above figure.

This has an interesting implication: \emph{the stronger the damping, the
slower the effective decay rate at long times}. Why does this happen? In
the over-damped regime, the motion of the oscillator is dominated by the
damping force rather than the spring force; as the oscillator tries to
return to its equilibrium position $x = 0$, the damping acts against
this motion. Hence, the stronger the damping, the slower the decay to
equilibrium.

This contrasts sharply with the underdamped case, where the spring
force dominates the damping force. In that case, stronger damping
speeds up the decay to equilibrium, by causing the kinetic energy of
the oscillation to be dissipated more rapidly.

\subsubsection{Critical damping}
\label{critical-damping}

\textbf{Critical damping} occurs when $\omega_0 = \gamma$. Under this
special condition, the solution we previous derived,
Eq.~\eqref{gensol}, reduces to
\begin{equation}
z(t) = \left(\psi_+ + \psi_-\right) e^{-\gamma t}.
\end{equation}
This has only \emph{one} independent complex parameter, i.e.~the
parameter $(\psi_+ + \psi_-)$. Therefore, it cannot be a general
solution for the complex damped harmonic oscillator equation, which is
still a second-order ODE.

We will not go into detail here regarding the procedure for finding
the general solution for the critically-damped oscillator, leaving it
as an exercise for the interested reader. Basically, we can Taylor
expand the solution on either side of the critical point, and then
show that there is a solution of the form
\begin{equation}
z(t) = \left(A + B t\right)\, e^{-\gamma t},
\label{criticalsol}
\end{equation}
which contains the desired two independent parameters.

The critically-damped solution contains an exponential decay constant
of $\gamma$, which is the same as the decay constant for the envelope
function in the underdamped regime, and \emph{smaller} than the
(long-time) decay constants in the overdamped regime. Hence, we can
regard the critically-damped solution as the \emph{fastest-decaying
  non-oscillatory solution}.

This feature of critical damping is employed in many engineering
contexts, the most familiar being automatic door closers. If the damping
is too weak or the spring force is too strong (under-damped), the door
will tend to slam shut, whereas if the damping is too strong or the
spring force is too weak (under-damping), the door will take
unnecessarily long to close. Hence, door closers need to be tuned to a
``sweet spot'' that corresponds to the critical damping point.

\subsection{Stating the solution in terms of initial conditions}
\label{stating-the-solution-in-terms-of-initial-conditions}

The general solution \eqref{gensol} contains two undetermined parameters
which are the complex amplitudes of the ``clockwise'' and
``counterclockwise'' complex oscillations:
\begin{equation}
z(t) = \psi_+ e^{-i\omega_+ t} + \psi_- e^{-i\omega_- t}, \quad\mathrm{where} \;\; \omega_\pm =  -i\gamma  \pm \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}.
\end{equation}
However, mechanics problems are often expressed in terms of an
\textbf{initial-value problem}, which expresses the state of the system
at some initial time $t = 0$. Suppose we are given $z(0) \equiv x_0$
and $\dot{z}(0) \equiv v_0$; then what is $z(t)$ in terms of $x_0$
and $v_0$?

We can solve the initial-value problem by finding $z(0)$ and
$\dot{z}(0)$ in terms of the above general solution for $z(t)$. The
results are
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
  z(0) &= \quad \psi_+ + \psi_- &= x_0& \\
  \dot{z}(0) &= -i\omega_+ \psi_+ - i \omega_- \psi_- &= v_0&.
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
These two equations can be combined into a 2x2 matrix equation:
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 \\ -i\omega_+ & -i\omega_-\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\psi_+ \\ \psi_-\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}x_0 \\ v_0\end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
So long as the system is not at the critical point (i.e.,
$\omega_+ \ne \omega_-$), the matrix is non-singular, and we can
invert it to obtain $\psi_\pm$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix}\psi_+ \\ \psi_-\end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{i(\omega_+-\omega_-)}\begin{bmatrix}-i\omega_-x_0 - v_0 \\ i\omega_+x_0 + v_0 \end{bmatrix}.
\end{equation}
We can plug these coefficients back into the general solution. After
some algebra, the result simplifies to
\begin{equation}
z(t) = e^{-\gamma t} \left[x_0 \cos(\Omega t) + \frac{\gamma x_0 + v_0}{\Omega} \, \sin(\Omega t)\right], \;\; \mathrm{where}\;\; \Omega \equiv \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}.
\end{equation}
For the under-damped case, $\Omega$ is real, and this solution is
consistent with the one we previously derived, except that it is now
explicitly expressed in terms our initial conditions $x_0$ and
$v_0$. As for the over-damped case, we can perform the replacement
\begin{equation}
\Omega \rightarrow i \Gamma = i \sqrt{\gamma^2 - \omega_0^2}.
\end{equation}
Then, using the relationships between trigonometric and hyperbolic
functions, the solution can be re-written as
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}z(t) &= e^{-\gamma t} \left[x_0 \cosh(\Gamma t) + \frac{\gamma x_0 + v_0}{i\Gamma} \, i \sinh(\Gamma t)\right] \\ &= \left(\frac{x_0}{2} + \frac{\gamma x_0 + v_0}{2\Gamma}\right) e^{-(\gamma - \Gamma) t} + \left(\frac{x_0}{2} - \frac{\gamma x_0 + v_0}{2\Gamma}\right) e^{-(\gamma+\Gamma)t},\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which is again consistent with our previous results.

In either case, so long as we plug in real values for $x_0$ and
$v_0$, the solution is guaranteed to be real for all $t$. That's to
be expected, since the real solution is also one of the specific
solutions for the complex harmonic oscillator equation.

\subsection{Exercises}\label{exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
In Section~\ref{complex-solution}, we encountered the complex
frequencies
\begin{equation}
  \omega_\pm = -i\gamma \pm \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}.
\end{equation}
For fixed $\omega_0$ and $\omega_0 > \gamma$ (under-damping), prove
that $\omega_\pm$ lie along a circular arc in the complex plane.

\item
Derive the general solution for the critically-damped oscillator by
following these steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Consider the complex ODE, in the under-damped regime $\omega_0 >
\gamma$. We previously showed (Section~\ref{complex-solution}) that
the general solution has the form
\begin{equation*}
  z(t) = \psi_+ \,
\exp\left[\left(-\gamma - i \sqrt{\omega_0^2 -
    \gamma^2}\right)t\right] \; +\; \psi_- \, \exp\left[\left(-\gamma
  +i\sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}\right)t\right]
\end{equation*}
for some complex parameters $\psi_+$ and $\psi_-$. Let us define the
positive parameter $\varepsilon = \sqrt{\omega_0^2 - \gamma^2}$.
Re-write $z(t)$ in terms of $\gamma$ and $\varepsilon$ (i.e.,
eliminating $\omega_0$).

\item
  The expression for $z(t)$ is presently parameterized by the
independent parameters $\psi_+$, $\psi_-$, $\varepsilon$, and
$\gamma$. We are free to re-define the parameters, by
taking
\begin{align}
  \alpha &= \psi_+ + \psi_- \\
  \beta &= -i\varepsilon(\psi_+ - \psi_-).
\end{align}
Using these equations, express $z(t)$ using a new set of independent
complex parameters, one of which is $\varepsilon$. You should
explicitly identify the other independent parameters, including
whether they are real or complex.

\item Expand the exponentials in $z(t)$ in terms of the parameter
  $\varepsilon$. Then show that in the limit $\varepsilon \rightarrow
  0$, $z(t)$ reduces to the solution given in Eq.~\eqref{criticalsol}.
\end{enumerate}

\item
  Repeat the above derivation for the critically-damped solution, but
  starting from the over-damped regime $\gamma > \omega_0$.

\item
  A \textbf{parametric oscillator} is an oscillator whose spring
``constant'' varies with time, as described by the ordinary differential
equation
\begin{equation}
  \left[\frac{d^2}{dt^2} + 2\gamma\frac{d}{dt} + \Omega(t)^2\right]x(t) = 0, \quad\mathrm{where}\;\;\Omega(t) = \omega_0\left[1 + \alpha \cos(2\omega_1 t)\right].
\end{equation}
The term ``parametric'' refers to the fact that the parameter
$\Omega$, which is normally a constant, has been turned into a
time-dependent quantity.

Suppose the ``modulation frequency'', $\omega_1$, is much smaller than
the natural frequency $\omega_0$. Let's make $x(t)$ complex, and
look for a solution of the form
\begin{equation}
  x(t) = \psi(t) \, e^{-i\omega_0 t},
\end{equation}
where $\psi(t)$ is a complex ``envelope function'' which varies much
more slowly than the $e^{-i\omega_0 t}$ factor. Mathematically, the
slowness of the variation is represented by the condition
\begin{equation}
  \left|\frac{d^2\psi}{dt^2}\right| \ll \omega_0 \left|\frac{d\psi}{dt}\right|.

In such a situation, the second time derivative can be neglected; this
is called the ``slowly-varying envelope approximation''. By making this
approximation, show that the parametric oscillator equation reduces to
the form
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\left[\ln(\psi)\right]}{dt} = f(t),
\end{equation}
and find $f(t)$. Hence, solve for $\psi(t)$ and show that the
oscillation ampitude $|\psi(t)|$ consists of an exponential decay
overlaid on a sinusoidal modulation.
