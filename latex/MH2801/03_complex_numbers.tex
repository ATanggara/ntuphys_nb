\section{Complex Numbers}
\label{complex-numbers}

The \textbf{imaginary unit}, denoted $i$, is defined as a solution to
the quadratic equation
\begin{equation}
  z^2 + 1 = 0.
\end{equation}
In other words, $i = \sqrt{-1}$. As we know, the above equation lacks
any real number solutions. For this concept to make sense, we must
extend our pre-established notions about what numbers are.

We will let the imaginary unit take part in the usual arithmetic
operations of addition and multiplication, treating it as an algebraic
quantity that can participate on the same footing as real numbers. It is
one of the most profound discoveries of mathematics that this seemingly
arbitrary idea gives rise to powerful computational methods with
applications in numerous fields.

\subsection{Complex algebra}
\label{complex-algebra}

Any \textbf{complex number} $z$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
  z = x + i y,
\end{equation}
where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers that are respectively called the
\textbf{real part} and the \textbf{imaginary part} of $z$. The real
and imaginary parts are also denoted as $\mathrm{Re}(z)$ and
$\mathrm{Im}(z)$, where $\mathrm{Re}$ and $\mathrm{Im}$ can be
regarded as functions mapping a complex number to a real number.

The set of complex numbers is denoted by $\mathbb{C}$. We can define
algebraic operations on complex numbers (addition, subtraction,
products, etc.)~by following the usual rules of algebra and setting
$i^2 = -1$ whenever it shows up.

\begin{framed}\noindent
  \textit{Example}---Let $z = x + i y$, where $x, y \in
  \mathbb{R}$. \\ What are the real and imaginary parts of $z^2$?
  \begin{align}
    z^2 &= (x+iy)^2 \\
    &= x^2 + 2x(iy) + (iy)^2 \\
    &= x^2 - y^2 + 2ixy
  \end{align}
  Hence,
  \begin{equation}
    \mathrm{Re}(z^2) = x^2 -y^2, \;\;\; \mathrm{Im}(z^2) = 2xy.
  \end{equation}
\end{framed}

We can also perform power operations on complex numbers, with one
caveat: for now, we'll only consider \emph{integer} powers like $z^2$
or $z^{-1} = 1/z$. Non-integer powers, such as $z^{1/3}$, introduce
vexatious complications which we'll postpone for now (we will figure
out how to deal with them when studying branch points and branch cuts
in Chapter 7).

Another useful fact: real coefficients (and \emph{only} real
coefficients) can be freely moved into or out of $\textrm{Re}(\cdots)$
and $\textrm{Im}(\cdots)$ operations:
\begin{equation}
  \left\{\begin{array}{l}
  \mathrm{Re}(\alpha z + \beta z') = \alpha \, \mathrm{Re}(z) + \beta\, \mathrm{Re}(z')\\
  \mathrm{Im}(\alpha z + \beta z') = \alpha \, \mathrm{Im}(z) + \beta\, \mathrm{Im}(z')\end{array}\right.\qquad\mathrm{for}\;\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}.
\end{equation}

As a consequence, if we have a complex function of a real variable, the
derivative of that function can be calculated from the derivatives of
the real and imaginary parts, as shown in the following example:

\begin{framed}\noindent
  \textit{Example}---If $z(t)$ is a complex function of a real input $t$, then
  \begin{equation}
    \mathrm{Re}\left[\frac{dz}{dt}\right] = \frac{d}{dt} \mathrm{Re}\left[z(t)\right], \;\;\textrm{and}\;\;\; \mathrm{Im}\left[\frac{dz}{dt}\right] = \frac{d}{dt} \mathrm{Im}\left[z(t)\right].
  \end{equation}
  This can be proven using the definition of the derivative:
  \begin{align}
    \mathrm{Re}\left[\frac{dz}{dt}\right]
    &= \;\; \mathrm{Re}\left[\lim_{\delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{z(t+\delta t) - z(t)}{\delta t}\right] \\
    &= \lim_{\delta t \rightarrow 0} \left[\frac{\mathrm{Re}[z(t+\delta t)] - \mathrm{Re}[z(t)]}{\delta t}\right] \\
    &= \frac{d}{dt} \mathrm{Re}\left[z(t)\right].
  \end{align}
  The $\mathrm{Im}[\cdots]$ case works out similarly. Note that the
  infinitesimal quantity $\delta t$ is real; otherwise, this wouldn't
  work.
\end{framed}

\subsection{Conjugates and Magnitudes}
\label{conjugates-and-magnitudes}

For each complex number $z = x + iy$, its \textbf{complex conjugate}
is a complex number whose imaginary part has the sign flipped:
\begin{equation}
  z^* = x - i y.
\end{equation}
Conjugation obeys two important properties:
\begin{align}
  (z_1 + z_2)^* &= z_1^* + z_2^* \\
  (z_1 z_2)^* &= z_1^* z_2^*.
\end{align}

\begin{framed}\noindent
  \textit{Example}---Let us prove that $(z_1 z_2)^* = z_1^*
  z_2^*$. First, let $z_1 = x_1 + i y_1$ and $z_2 = x_2 + i y_2$.
  Then,
  \begin{align}
    (z_1 z_2)^* &= \left[(x_1+iy_1)(x_2+iy_2)\right]^* \\
    &= \left[\left(x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2\right)
      + i\left(x_1y_2+y_1x_2\right)\right]^* \\
    &= \left(x_1 x_2 - y_1 y_2\right) - i\left(x_1y_2+y_1x_2\right) \\
    &= \left(x_1 - i y_1\right)\left(x_2 - i y_2\right) \\
    &= z_1^* z_2^*
  \end{align}
\end{framed}

For a complex number $z = x + i y$, the \textbf{magnitude} of the
complex number is
\begin{equation}
|z| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\end{equation}
This is a non-negative real number. A complex number and its conjugate
have the same magnitude: $|z| = |z^*|$. Also, we can show that complex
magnitudes have the property
\begin{equation}
  |z_1 z_2| = |z_1| \, |z_2|.
\end{equation}
This property is similar to the ``absolute value'' operation for real
numbers, hence the similar notation.

As a corollary, taking a power of a complex number raises its
magnitude by the same power:
\begin{equation}
|z^n| = |z|^n \;\;\;\textrm{for}\;\;n \in \mathbb{Z}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Euler's formula}
\label{eulers-formula}

Euler's formula is an extremely important result which states that
\begin{equation}
  e^{iz} = \cos(z) + i \sin(z).
  \label{eulerf}
\end{equation}
To prove this, recall the definition of the exponential from Chapter
0:
\begin{equation}
  \exp(z) = 1 + z + \frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^3}{3!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} + \frac{z^5}{5!} + \frac{z^6}{6!} + \cdots
\end{equation}
Previously, we assumed the input to the exponential to be a real
number.  But since complex numbers can be added and multiplied using
the same rules of algebra as real numbers, we can adopt the same
series formula as the definition of the \textbf{complex exponential},
a function that takes complex inputs and gives complex outputs. When
the input happens to be real, the complex exponential gives the same
result as the original real exponential.

Plugging $iz$ as the input to the complex exponential function gives
\begin{align}
  \exp(iz) &= 1 + (iz) + \frac{(iz)^2}{2!} + \frac{(iz)^3}{3!}
  + \frac{(iz)^4}{4!} + \frac{(iz)^5}{5!} + \frac{(iz)^6}{6!} + \cdots \\
  &= 1 + iz - \frac{z^2}{2!} - i \frac{z^3}{3!} + \frac{z^4}{4!}
  + i \frac{z^5}{5!} - \frac{z^6}{6!} + \cdots \\
  & = \left(1 - \frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} - \frac{z^6}{6!}
  + \cdots\right) + i\left(z  - \frac{z^3}{3!}  + \frac{z^5}{5!}
  - \frac{z^7}{7!} + \cdots\right).
  \label{expiz}
\end{align}
Now, compare the two terms in parentheses to the series expansions for
the cosine and sine functions from Chapter 1. We can define the
\textbf{complex cosine} and \textbf{complex sine} functions using the
corresponding complex series:
\begin{align}
  \cos(z) &= 1 - \frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} - \frac{z^6}{6!} + \cdots \\
  \sin(z) &= z - \frac{z^3}{3!} + \frac{z^5}{5!} - \frac{z^7}{7!} + \cdots
\end{align}
These are perfect matches for the real and imaginary parts of
Eq.~\eqref{expiz}!  Hence, we have proven Eq.~\eqref{eulerf}.

One important consequence of Euler's formula is that
\begin{equation}
  \left|e^{i\theta}\right| = \sqrt{\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta)}
  = 1 \qquad \mathrm{for}\; \theta \in \mathbb{R}.
\end{equation}

Another consequence is that
\begin{equation}
e^{i\pi} = -1,
\end{equation}
which is a formula that relates two transcendental constants $e =
2.7182818285\dots$ and $\pi = 3.141592654\dots$, by means of the
imaginary unit. (We saw a different relationship between these two
constants when solving the Gaussian integral in Chapter 2.)

\subsection{The complex plane}
\label{the-complex-plane}

A convenient way to conceptualize a complex number is to think of it
as a point on a two-dimensional plane, called the \textbf{complex
  plane}, as shown in the figure below.  The real and imaginary parts
are the horizontal and vertical Cartesian coordinates in the
plane. The horizontal ($x$) and vertical ($y$) coordinate axes are
called the ``real axis'' and the ``imaginary axis'', respectively.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{complex_plane}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Polar representation}
\label{polar-representation}

If we think of a complex number as a point on the complex plane, its
position can also be represented using polar coordinates instead of
Cartesian coordinates. For a complex number $z = x + i y$, we can
introduce polar coordinates $r$ and $\theta$ (both real numbers), such
that
\begin{equation}
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}, \;\;\; \theta = \tan^{-1}(y/x).
\end{equation}
Conversely,
\begin{equation}
x = r\cos\theta, \;\;\; y = r\sin\theta.
\end{equation}
These are the usual formulas for performing a change of coordinate
between two-dimensional Cartesian coordinates and polar coordinates,
as shown below. The radial coordinate is the magnitude of the complex
number: $r = |z|$. The azimuthal coordinate $\theta$ is called the
\textbf{argument} of the complex number, which is also denoted by
$\mathrm{arg}(z)$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{complex_plane2}
\end{figure}

Note, by the way, that the complex zero, $z = 0$, has zero magnitude
and \emph{undefined} argument.

Using Euler's formula \eqref{eulerf}, we can write
\begin{align}
  z &= r\cos(\theta) + i r\sin(\theta)\\
  &= r \left[\cos(\theta) + i \sin(\theta)\right] \\
  &= r \, e^{i\theta}.
\end{align}
Therefore, whenever we can manipulate a complex number into a form $A
e^{iB}$, where $A$ and $B$ are real numbers, then $A$ is the magnitude
and $B$ is the argument. This is used in the following example:


\begin{framed}\noindent
  \textit{Example}---For $z \in \mathbb{C}$, it can be shown that the
  magnitude and argument of $\exp(z)$ are:
  \begin{equation}
    \left|\exp(z)\right| = e^{\mathrm{Re}(z)}, \quad \mathrm{arg}\left[\exp(z)\right] = \mathrm{Im}(z).
  \end{equation}
  Proof: Let $z = x + i y$, where $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$; then
  \begin{equation}
    e^{z} = e^{x + i y} = e^x \, e^{iy}.
  \end{equation}
  By inspection, the magnitude of this complex number is $e^x$, and
  its argument is $y$.
\end{framed}

\subsubsection{Geometrical interpretation of complex operations}
\label{geometrical-interpretation-of-complex-operations}

Using the complex plane, we can give useful geometric interpretations to
the basic operations on complex numbers:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Addition of two complex numbers can be interpreted as the addition of
  two coordinate vectors. If $z_1 = x_1 + i y_1$ and
  $z_2 = x_2 + i y_2$, then
  \begin{equation}
    z_1 + z_2 = \left(x_1 + x_2\right) + i\left(y_1 + y_2\right).
  \end{equation}
  Hence, the point corresponding to $z_1 + z_2$ is obtained by adding
  the two coordinate vectors corresponding to $z_1$ and $z_2$. From
  this, we can geometrically prove a useful inequality relation
  between complex numbers, called the ``triangle inequality'':
  \begin{equation}
    |z_1 + z_2| \le |z_1| + |z_2|.
  \end{equation}

\item
  Complex multiplication can be interpreted as a scaling together with a
  rotation. If $z_1 = r_1e^{i\theta_1}$ and
  $z_2 = r_2e^{i\theta_2}$, then
  \begin{equation}
    z_1 z_2 = \left(r_1 r_2\right) \,\exp[i(\theta_1 + \theta_2)].
  \end{equation}
  Hence, the point corresponding to $z_1 \, z_2$ is obtained by
  scaling the $z_1$ coordinate vector by a factor of $|z_2|$, and
  rotating it by an angle of $\theta_2$ around the origin. In
  particular, multiplication by $e^{i\theta}$ is equivalent to a
  rotation by angle $\theta$.

\item
  The conjugation operation (Section~\ref{conjugates-and-magnitudes})
  is equivalent to reflection about the real axis. It moves a point
  from the upper half of the complex plane to the lower half, or vice
  versa.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Complex numbers have no ordering}
\label{complex-numbers-have-no-ordering}

One consequence of the fact that complex numbers reside in a
two-dimensional plane is that \emph{inequality relations are undefined
  for complex numbers}. This is one important difference between
complex and real numbers.

Real numbers can be \textbf{ordered}, meaning that for any two real
numbers $a$ and $b$, one and only one of the following is true:
\begin{equation}
  a < b \;\; \mathrm{OR} \;\; a = b \;\; \mathrm{OR}\;\; a > b.
\end{equation}
In geometrical terms, these ordering relations exist because the real
numbers reside along a one-dimensional line.

But since complex numbers lie in a two-dimensional plane, it is
nonsensical to write something like $z_1 < z_2$, where $z_1$ and $z_2$
are complex numbers. (It is, however, valid to write $|z_1| < |z_2|$,
since magnitudes are real.)

\subsection{Complex functions}
\label{complex-functions}

When deriving Euler's formula in Section~\ref{eulers-formula}, we
introduced \textbf{complex functions} that were defined by takingreal
mathematical functions, like the exponential, and making them accept
complex number inputs. Let us take a closer look at how these complex
functions behave.

\subsubsection{Complex trigonometric functions}
\label{complex-trigonometric-functions}

The complex sine and cosine functions are defined using the same
series expansions as the real cosine and sine functions, except that
the inputs $z$ are allowed to be complex:
\begin{equation}
\left\{\begin{array}{l}\displaystyle\sin(z) = z - \frac{z^3}{3!} + \frac{z^5}{5!} - \frac{z^7}{7!} + \cdots\\ \displaystyle\cos(z) = 1 - \frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} - \frac{z^6}{6!} + \cdots,\end{array}\right.\quad\quad z\in \mathbb{C}
\end{equation}
It is important to note that the \emph{outputs} of the complex
trigonometric functions are complex numbers too.

Some familiar properties of the real trigonometric functions do not
apply to the complex versions. For instance, $|\sin(z)|$ and
$|\cos(z)|$ are \emph{not} bounded by 1 when $z$ is not real.

        
We can also write the complex cosine and sine functions in terms of
the exponential:
\begin{align}
  \cos(z) &= \;\;\frac{1}{2}\left(e^{iz} + e^{-iz}\right) \label{cosz} \\
  \sin(z) &= -\frac{i}{2}\left(e^{iz} - e^{-iz}\right). \label{sinz}
\end{align}
This is often a convenient step when solving integrals, as shown in
the following example:

\begin{framed}\noindent
  \textit{Example}---Consider the real integral
  \begin{equation}
    I = \int_0^\infty dx \; e^{- x} \, \cos(x).
  \end{equation}
  One way to solve this is to use integration by parts, but another
  way is to use the complex expansion of the cosine
  function:
  \begin{align}
    I &= \int_0^\infty dx \; e^{- x} \,\frac{1}{2}\,
    \left[e^{ix} + e^{-ix}\right] \\
    &= \frac{1}{2} \int_0^\infty dx \; \left[e^{(-1+i)x} + e^{(-1-i)x}\right] \\
    &= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{e^{(-1+i) x}}{-1+i}
      + \frac{e^{(-1 - i) x}}{-1 - i}\right]_0^\infty
    \\ &= -\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{1}{-1+i} + \frac{1}{-1 - i}\right)
    \\ &= \frac{1}{2}.
  \end{align}
\end{framed}
    
\subsubsection{Complex trigonometric identities}

Euler's formula provides a convenient way to deal with trigonometric
functions. Consider the addition formulas
\begin{align}
  \sin(z_1 + z_2) &= \sin(z_1) \cos(z_2) + \cos(z_1)\sin(z_2) \\
  \cos(z_1 + z_2) &= \cos(z_1) \cos(z_2) - \sin(z_1)\sin(z_2).
\end{align}
The standard proofs for these formulas are geometric: you draw a
figure, and solve a bunch of relations between the angles and sides of
the various triangles, making use of the Pythagorean formula. But
using the Euler formula, we can prove these algebraically. For
example,
\begin{align}
  \cos(z_1)\cos(z_2)
  &= \frac{1}{4}\left(e^{iz_1} + e^{-iz_1}\right)
  \left(e^{iz_2} + e^{-iz_1}\right)\\
  &= \frac{1}{4}\left[e^{i(z_1+z_2)} + e^{i(-z_1 + z_2)} + e^{i(z_1 -z_2)}
    + e^{-i(z_1+z_2)}\right] \\
  \sin(z_1)\sin(z_2)
  &= -\frac{1}{4}\left(e^{iz_1} - e^{-iz_1}\right)
  \left(e^{iz_2} - e^{-iz_1}\right) \\
  &= -\frac{1}{4}\left[e^{i(z_1+z_2)} - e^{i(-z_1 + z_2)}
    - e^{i(z_1 -z_2)} + e^{-i(z_1+z_2)}\right].
\end{align}
Thus,
\begin{equation}
  \cos(z_1) \cos(z_2) - \sin(z_1)\sin(z_2)
  = \frac{1}{2}\left[e^{i(z_1+z_2)} + e^{-i(z_1+z_2)}\right] = \cos(z_1 + z_2).
\end{equation}
As a bonus, these addition formulas now hold for complex inputs as
well, not just real inputs.

\subsubsection{Hyperbolic functions}
\label{hyperbolic-functions}

Euler's formula also provides us with a link between the trionometric
and hyperbolic functions. From the definition of the hyperbolic
functions from Chapter 0:
\begin{equation}
  \sinh(z) = \frac{1}{2}\left(e^{z} - e^{-z}\right), \quad\; \cosh(z) = \frac{1}{2}\left(e^{z} + e^{-z}\right)
\end{equation}
Comparing this to Eqs.~\eqref{cosz}--\eqref{sinz}, we can see that the
trigonometric and hyperbolic functions are related by
\begin{align}
  \sin(z) &= -i \sinh(iz), \quad \cos(z) = \cosh(iz) \\
  \sinh(z) &= -i \sin(iz), \quad \cosh(z) = \cos(iz)
\end{align}
Using these relations, we can relate the addition formulas for
trignometric formulas to the addition formulas for hyperbolic
functions, e.g.
\begin{align}
  \cosh(z_1+z_2) &= \cos(iz_1 + iz_2) \\
  &= \cos(iz_1)\cos(iz_2) - \sin(iz_1)\sin(iz_2) \\
  &= \cosh(z_1)\cosh(z_2) + \sinh(z_1)\sinh(z_2).
\end{align}

\subsection{Trajectories in the complex plane}
\label{trajectories-in-the-complex-plane}

If we have a function $z(t)$ which takes a real input $t$ and outputs
a complex number $z$, it is often useful to plot a curve in the
complex plane called the ``parametric trajectory'' of $z$. Each point
on this curve indicates the value of $z$ for a particular value of
$t$. We will give a few examples below.

First, consider
\begin{equation}
  z(t) = e^{i\omega t}, \quad \omega \in \mathbb{R}.
\end{equation}
The trajectory is a circle in the complex plane, centered at the
origin and with radius 1:

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.37\textwidth]{complex_trajectory_1}
\end{figure}

\noindent
To see why, observe that the function has the form $z(t) =
r(t)\,e^{i\theta(t)}$, which has magnitude $r(t) = 1$, and argument
$\theta(t) = \omega t$ varying proportionally with $t$. If $\omega$ is
positive, the argument increases with $t$, so the trajectory is
counter-clockwise.  If $\omega$ is negative, the trajectory is
clockwise.

\clearpage

Next, consider
\begin{equation}
  z(t) = e^{(\gamma + i \omega) t},
\end{equation}
where $\gamma,\omega \in \mathbb{R}.$ For $\gamma = 0$, this reduces
to the previous example. For $\gamma \ne 0$, the trajectory is a
spiral:

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.37\textwidth]{complex_trajectory_2}
\end{figure}

\noindent
To see this, we again observe that this function can be written in the
form
\begin{equation}
  z(t) = r(t) \;e^{i\theta(t)},
\end{equation}
where $r(t) = e^{\gamma t}$ and $\theta = \omega t.$ The argument
varies proportionally with $t$, so the trajectory loops around the
origin. The magnitude increases with $t$ if $\gamma$ is positive, and
decreases with $t$ if $\gamma$ is negative. Thus, for instance, if
$\gamma$ and $\omega$ are both positive, then the trajectory is an
anticlockwise spiral moving outwards from the origin. Try checking how
the trajectory behaves when the signs of $\gamma$ and/or $\omega$ are
flipping.

Finally, consider
\begin{equation}
  z(t) = \frac{1}{\alpha t + \beta}, \quad \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}.
\end{equation}
This trajectory is a circle which passes through the origin, as shown
below:

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.37\textwidth]{complex_trajectory_3}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Showing this requires a bit of ingenuity, and is left as an
exercise. This is an example of something called a
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M\%C3\%B6bius_transformation}{Möbius
  transformation}.

\subsection{Why complex numbers?}\label{why-complex-numbers}

Here are some questions that might have occurred to you:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  If we extend the concept of numbers to complex numbers, why stop here?
  Why not extend the concept further, and formulate other abstract
  number systems that are even more complicated than complex numbers?
\item
  Integers and real numbers have intuitive connections to the phenomena
  we experience in everyday life, such as the counting of discrete
  objects, or measuring lengths and weights. Complex numbers, however,
  seem like completely abstract concepts. Why should we study them?
\end{itemize}

As we have seen, complex numbers are appealing mathematical objects
because they can be manipulated via the same rules of algebra as real
numbers. We can add, subtract, multiply, and divide them (apart from
division by zero), without running into any logical
inconsistencies. One limitation is that complex numbers have no
ordering (Section~\ref{complex-numbers-have-no-ordering}), so complex
algebra only involves equations, not inequality relations.

One very important feature possessed by complex numbers and not real
numbers is that the complex numbers are \emph{algebraically closed}.
This means that all complex polynomial equations have solutions in
$\mathbb{C}$. The set of real numbers, $\mathbb{R}$, lacks this
property: there are certain real algebraic equations, like
$x^2 + 1 = 0$, which have no solution in $\mathbb{R}$. The
``closure'' property of $\mathbb{C}$ is called the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra}{Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra}, which gives an idea of its importance. As a
consequence, $\mathbb{C}$ cannot be generalized to a more complicated
number system via the same route used to extend $\mathbb{R}$ into
$\mathbb{C}$.

There do exist number systems more complicated than the complex numbers,
which are formulated not by algebraic extension but by discarding one or
more of the usual rules of algebra. The
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion}{quaternions} are a
system of four-component numbers obeying an algebra that is
\emph{non-commutative} (i.e., $ab = ba$ is not generally true). The
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion}{octonions} are an even
more complicated system of eight-component numbers which are not only
non-commutative but also non-associative (i.e., $(ab)c = a(bc)$ is not
generally true). These and other still-more-complicated number systems
have a few applications in physics and other fields, but are overall
much less important than $\mathbb{C}$.

One big reason that complex numbers have proven to be so important and
useful is that it's easy to formulate a version of calculus for them.
The study of smooth complex functions, and their derivatives and
integrals, is called \textbf{complex analysis}.  We will discuss this
subject extensively later in the course.  We shall see that complex
analysis has important implications for the \emph{real} calculus; for
example, many real integrals can be easily solved by first
generalizing them into complex integrals. By contrast, since
quaternions and octonions are not commutative, the concept of
``derivative'' is tricky to define for these number systems, making it
harder to formulate a useful calculus with them.

\subsection{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Let $z = x + iy$, where $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$. For each of the
  following expressions, find (i) the real part, (ii) the imaginary
  part, (iii) the magnitude, and (iv) the complex argument, in terms of
  $x$ and $y$:

  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item $z^2$
  \item $1/z$
  \item $\exp(z)$
  \item $\exp(iz)$
  \item $\cos(z)$
  \end{enumerate}

\item
  Prove that $|z_1 z_2| = |z_1|\, |z_2|$, by using (i) the polar
  representation, and (ii) the Cartesian representation.

\item
  Prove that $(z_1 z_2)^* = z_1^* z_2^*$, by using (i) the polar
  representation, and (ii) the Cartesian representation.

\item
  Identify the problem with this chain of equations: $-1 = i \cdot i =
  \sqrt{-1}\,\sqrt{-1} = \sqrt{-1 \cdot -1} = \sqrt{1} = 1.$

\item
  With the aid of Euler's formula, prove that
  \begin{align}
    \cos(3x) &= 4[\cos(x)]^3 -3\cos(x) \\
    \sin(3x) &= 3\sin(x)-4[\sin(x)]^3
  \end{align}

\item
  For $z_1, z_2 \in \mathbb{C}$ and $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$, show that
  $\mathrm{Re}\left[z_1 e^{i\theta} + z_2 e^{-i\theta}\right] = A
  \cos(\theta) + B \sin(\theta)$, for some $A, B \in \mathbb{R}$. Find
  explicit expressions for $A$ and $B$ in terms of $z_1$ and $z_2$.

\item
  In Section~\ref{the-complex-plane}, we saw that the conjugation
  operation corresponds to a reflection about the real axis. What
  operation corresponds to a reflection about the imaginary axis?

\item
  Consider the complex function of a real variable $z(t) = 1/(\alpha t
  + \beta)$, where $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{C}$ and $t \in
  \mathbb{R}$.

  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item
    For $\alpha = 1$ and $\beta = i$, show that $z(t)$ can be
    re-expressed as $z(s) = (1+e^{is})/(2i)$, where
    $s \in (-\pi,\pi)$. Hint: find a real mapping $t(s)$.

  \item
    Hence, show that the trajectory for arbitrary complex values of
    $\alpha,\, \beta$ has the form of a circle.
  \end{enumerate}

\item
  With the help of a computer plotting program, generate complex
  trajectories for the following functions (for real inputs $t
  \in\mathbb{R}$). Explain their key features, including the
  directions of the trajectories:
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item
    $\displaystyle z(t) = \left[1+\frac{\cos(\beta t)}{2}\right] \, \exp(it)$,
    for $\beta = 10$ and for $\beta = \sqrt{5}$.
  \item
    $\displaystyle z(t) = -it \pm \sqrt{1 - t^2}$.
  \item
    $\displaystyle z(t) = ae^{it} + be^{-it}$, for $a = 1, b = -2$
    and for $a = 1, b = 2$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
