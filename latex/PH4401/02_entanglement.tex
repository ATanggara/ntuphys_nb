\section{Quantum states of multi-particle systems}
\label{sec:tensorprod}

So far, we have studied quantum mechanical systems consisting of
single particles.  The next important step is to look at systems of
more than one particle.  We shall see that the postulates of quantum
mechanics, when applied to multi-particle systems, give rise to
interesting and counterintuitive phenomena such as \textbf{quantum
  entanglement}.

Suppose we have two particles labeled $A$ and $B$.  If each individual
particle is treated as a quantum system, the postulates of quantum
mechanics require that its state be described by a vector in a Hilbert
space.  Let $\mathscr{H}_A$ and $\mathscr{H}_B$ denote the respective
single-particle Hilbert spaces.  Then the Hilbert space for the
combined system of two particles is
\begin{equation}
  \mathscr{H} = \mathscr{H}_A\otimes \mathscr{H}_B.
\end{equation}
The symbol $\otimes$ refers to a \textbf{tensor product}, a
mathematical operation that combines two Hilbert spaces to form
another Hilbert space.  It is most easily understood in terms of
explicit basis vectors: let $\mathscr{H}_A$ be spanned by a basis
$\{|\mu_1\rangle, |\mu_2\rangle, |\mu_3\rangle, \dots\}$, and
$\mathscr{H}_B$ be spanned by $\{|\nu_1\rangle, |\nu_2\rangle,
|\nu_3\rangle, \dots\}$.  Then $\mathscr{H}_A \otimes \mathscr{H}_B$
is a space spanned by basis vectors consisting of \textit{pairwise
  combinations} of basis vectors drawn from the $\mathscr{H}_A$ and
$\mathscr{H}_B$ bases:
\begin{equation}
  \Big\{\;\,|\mu_i\rangle\otimes|\nu_j\rangle \;\;  \textrm{for} \; \textrm{all}\;\,|\mu_i\rangle,\; |\nu_j\rangle \;\,\Big\}.
\end{equation}

Thus, if $\mathscr{H}_A$ has dimension $d_A$ and $\mathscr{H}_B$ has
dimension $d_B$, then $\mathscr{H}_A\otimes \mathscr{H}_B$ has
dimension $d_A d_B$.  Any two-particle state can be written as a
superposition of these basis vectors:
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \sum_{ij} \, c_{ij}\; |\mu_i\rangle \otimes |\nu_j\rangle.
\end{equation}

The inner product between the tensor product basis states is defined
as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \Big(|\mu_i\rangle \otimes |\nu_j\rangle\;,\; |\mu_p\rangle \otimes |\nu_q\rangle \Big) \;\equiv\; \Big(\langle\mu_i| \otimes \langle\nu_j| \Big) \Big(|\mu_p\rangle \otimes |\nu_q\rangle\Big) \;\equiv\; \langle\mu_i|\mu_p\rangle \, \langle\nu_j|\nu_q\rangle = \delta_{ip}\delta_{jq}.
  \label{innerprod}
\end{equation}
In other words, the inner product is performed ``slot-by-slot''.  We
calculate the inner product for $A$, calculate the inner product for
$B$, and then multiply the two resulting numbers.  You can check that
this satisfies all the formal requirements for an inner product in
linear algebra (see \hyperref[ex:innerprod]{Exercise 1}).

For example, suppose $\mathscr{H}_A$ and $\mathscr{H}_B$ are both 2D
Hilbert spaces describing spin-$1/2$ degrees of freedom.  Each space
can be spanned by an orthonormal basis $\{\,|\!+\!z\rangle,
\,|\!-\!z\rangle \, \}$, representing ``spin-up'' and ``spin-down''.
Then the tensor product space $\mathscr{H}$ is a 4D space spanned by
\begin{equation}
  \Big\{\;|\!+\!z\rangle\otimes|\!+\!z\rangle\,,\; |\!+\!z\rangle\otimes|\!-\!z\rangle\,,\; |\!-z\!\rangle\otimes|\!+\!z\rangle\,,\; |\!-\!z\rangle\otimes|\!-\!z\rangle \;\Big\}.
  \label{spin12}
\end{equation}

We now make an important observation.  If $A$ is in state
$|\mu\rangle$ and $B$ is in state $|\nu\rangle$, then the state of the
combined system is fully specified: $|\mu\rangle \otimes |\nu\rangle
\in \mathscr{H}_A \otimes \mathscr{H}_B$.  But the reverse is not
generally true!  There exist states of the combined system that
\textit{cannot} be expressed in terms of definite states of the
individual particles.  For example, consider the following quantum
state of two spin-$1/2$ particles:
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Big(|\!+\!z\rangle\otimes|\!-\!z\rangle \,-\, |\!-\!z\rangle\otimes|\!+\!z\rangle\Big).
  \label{entangled_state}
\end{equation}
This state is constructed from two of the four basis states in
\eqref{spin12}, and you can check that the factor of $1/\sqrt{2}$
ensures the normalization $\langle\psi|\psi\rangle = 1$ with the inner
product rule \eqref{innerprod}.  It is evident from looking at
Eq.~\eqref{entangled_state} that neither $A$ nor $B$ possesses a
definite $|\!+\!z\rangle$ or $|\!-\!z\rangle$ state.  Moreover, we
shall show (in Section~\ref{sec:entropy}) that there's \textit{no}
choice of basis that allows this state to be expressed in terms of
definite individual-particle states; i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle \ne |\psi_A\rangle\otimes|\psi_B\rangle \;\;\;\textrm{for}\;\textrm{any}\;\; |\psi_A\rangle \in \mathscr{H}_A, \;|\psi_B\rangle \in \mathscr{H}_B.
\end{equation}
In such a situation, the two particles are said to be
\textbf{entangled}.

It is cumbersome to keep writing $\otimes$ symbols, so we will
henceforth omit the $\otimes$ in cases where the tensor product is
obvious.  For instance,
\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Big(|\!+\!z\rangle\otimes|\!-\!z\rangle \,-\, |\!-\!z\rangle\otimes|\!+\!z\rangle\Big) \;\;\equiv \;\; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Big(|\!+\!z\rangle|\!-\!z\rangle \,-\, |\!-\!z\rangle|\!+\!z\rangle\Big).
\end{equation}

For systems of more than two particles, quantum states can be defined
using multiple tensor products.  Suppose a quantum system contains $N$
particles described by the individual Hilbert spaces $\{\mathscr{H}_1,
\mathscr{H}_2, \dots, \mathscr{H}_N\}$ having dimensionality $\{d_1,
\dots, d_N\}$.  Then the overall system is described by the Hilbert
space
\begin{equation}
  \mathscr{H} = \mathscr{H}_1 \otimes \mathscr{H}_2 \otimes \cdots
  \otimes \mathscr{H}_N,
\end{equation}
which has dimensionality $d = d_1 d_2\cdots d_N$.  The dimensionality
scales exponentially with the number of particles!  For instance, if
each particle has a 2D Hilbert space, a $20$-particle system has a
Hilbert space with $2^{20} =1\,048\,576$ dimensions.  Thus, even in
quantum systems with a modest number of particles, the quantum state
can carry huge amounts of information.  This is one of the motivations
behind the active research field of quantum computing.

Finally, a proviso: although we refer to subsystems like $A$ and $B$
as ``particles'' for narrative convenience, they need not be actual
particles.  All this formalism applies to general subsystems---i.e.,
subsets of a large quantum system's degrees of freedom.  For instance,
if a quantum system has a position eigenbasis for 3D space, the $x$,
$y$, and $z$ coordinates are distinct degrees of freedom, so each
position eigenstate is really a tensor product:
\begin{equation*}
  |\,\mathbf{r} = (x,y,z)\,\rangle \;\equiv\; |x\rangle\, |y\rangle\, |z\rangle.
\end{equation*}
Also, if the subsystems really \textit{are} particles, we are going to
assume for now that the particles are distinguishable.  There are
other complications that arise if the particles are
``indistinguishable'', which will be the subject of the next chapter.
(If you're unsure what this means, just read on.)


\section{Partial measurements}
\label{sec:partialmeasurements}

Let us recall how measurements work in single-particle quantum theory.
Each observable $Q$ is described by some Hermitian operator $\hat{Q}$,
which has an eigenbasis $\{|q_i\rangle\}$ such that
\begin{equation}
  \hat{Q}|q_i\rangle = q_i |q_i\rangle.
\end{equation}
For simplicity, let the eigenvalues $\{q_i\}$ be non-degenerate.
Suppose a particle initially has quantum state $|\psi\rangle$.  This
can always be expanded in terms of the eigenbasis of $\hat{Q}$:
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \sum_i \psi_i\, |q_i\rangle, \;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;\,\textrm{and}\;\, \psi_i = \langle q_i|\psi\rangle.
\end{equation}
The \textbf{measurement postulate of quantum mechanics} states that if
we measure $Q$, then (i) the probability of obtaining the measurement
outcome $q_i$ is $P_i = |\psi_i|^2$, the absolute square of the
coefficient of $|q_i\rangle$ in the basis expansion; and (ii) upon
obtaining this outcome, the system instantly ``collapses'' into state
$|q_i\rangle$.

Mathematically, these two rules can be summarized using the projection
operator
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\Pi}(q_i) = |q_i\rangle\langle q_i|.
\end{equation}
Applying this operator to $|\psi\rangle$ gives
\begin{equation}
  |\psi'\rangle = |q_i\rangle \langle q_i|\psi\rangle,
\end{equation}
which is not normalized to unity.  Then:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The probability of obtaining this outcome is
  $\langle\psi'|\psi'\rangle = |\langle q_i|\psi\rangle|^2$.

\item The post-collapse state is obtained by the re-normalization
  $|\psi'\rangle \rightarrow |q_i\rangle$.
\end{enumerate}

For multi-particle systems, there is a new complication: what if a
measurement is performed on just one particle?

Consider a system of two particles A and B, with two-particle Hilbert
space $\mathscr{H}_A \otimes \mathscr{H}_B$.  We perform a measurement
on particle $A$, corresponding to a Hermitian operator $\hat{\mu}$
that acts upon $\mathscr{H}_A$ and has eigenvectors $\{|\mu_1\rangle,
|\mu_2\rangle,\dots\}$.  We can write any state $|\psi\rangle$ using
the eigenbasis of $\hat{\mu}$ for the $\mathscr{H}_A$ part, and an
arbitrary basis $\{|\nu_1\rangle, |\nu_2\rangle,\dots\}$ for the
$\mathscr{H}_B$ part:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}|\psi\rangle &= \sum_{ij} \psi_{ij}\, |\mu_i\rangle |\nu_j\rangle \\&= \sum_i |\mu_i\rangle |\varphi_i\rangle, \;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;|\varphi_i\rangle\equiv \sum_j \psi_{ij}\,|\nu_j\rangle.\end{aligned}
\end{align}
Unlike the single-particle case, the ``coefficient'' of
$|\mu_i\rangle$ in this basis expansion is not a complex number, but a
vector $|\varphi_i\rangle \in \mathscr{H}_B$.  Proceeding by analogy,
the probability of obtaining the outcome $\mu_i$ ought to be the
``absolute square'' of this ``coefficient'',
$\langle\varphi_i|\varphi_i\rangle$.  To make the analogy a bit more
rigorous, let us define the partial projector
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\Pi}(\mu_i) \,=\, |\mu_i\rangle\langle \mu_i| \otimes  \hat{I}.
\end{equation}
This contains a projector, $|\mu_i\rangle\langle \mu_i|$, which only
acts upon the $\mathscr{H}_A$ part of the two-particle space.
Applying this to the above multi-particle state gives
\begin{equation}
  |\psi'\rangle = \hat{\Pi}(\mu_i)\, |\psi\rangle
  = |\mu_i\rangle |\varphi_i\rangle.
\end{equation}
Now we can follow the same measurement rules as before.  The outcome
probability is
\begin{equation}
  P_i = \langle\psi'|\psi'\rangle = \langle \mu_i|\mu_i\rangle\, \langle \varphi_i|\varphi_i\rangle = \sum_j |\psi_{ij}|^2,
\end{equation}
and the post-measurement collapsed state is obtained by the
re-normalization
\begin{equation}
  |\psi'\rangle
 \;\;\rightarrow\;\;
 \frac{1}{\sqrt{\sum_{j'} |\psi_{ij'}|^2}}\;
 \sum_{j} \psi_{ij} |\mu_i\rangle |\nu_j\rangle.
\end{equation}

Let's work through an example.  Consider a system of two spin-$1/2$
particles, with state
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Big(|\!+\!z\rangle|\!-\!z\rangle \,-\, |\!-\!z\rangle|\!+\!z\rangle\Big).
\end{equation}
For each particle, $|\!+\!z\,\rangle$ and $|\!-\!z\,\rangle$ denote
eigenstates of the operator $\hat{S}_z$, with eigenvalues $+\hbar/2$
and $-\hbar/2$ respectively.  Suppose we measure $S_z$ on particle A.
There are two possible outcomes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{First outcome: $+\hbar/2$}.  The projection operator is
  $|\!+\!z\rangle\langle+z| \otimes \hat{I}$, and applying this to
  $|\psi\rangle$ yields $|\psi'\rangle =
  (1/\sqrt{2})\,|\!+\!z\rangle|\!-\!z\rangle$.  Hence, the outcome
  probability is $P_+ = \langle \psi'|\psi;\rangle = \frac{1}{2}$ and
  the post-collapse state is $|\!+\!z\rangle |\!-\!z\rangle$.

\item \textbf{Second outcome: $-\hbar/2$}.  The projection operator is
  $|\!-\!z\rangle\langle-z| \otimes \hat{I}$, and applying this to
  $|\psi\rangle$ yields $|\psi'\rangle =
  (1/\sqrt{2})\,|\!-\!z\rangle|\!+\!z\rangle$.  Hence, the outcome
  probability is $P_- = \langle \psi'|\psi'\rangle = \frac{1}{2}$ and
  the post-collapse state is $|\!-\!z\rangle |\!+\!z\rangle$.
\end{itemize}
The two possible outcomes, $+\hbar/2$ and $-\hbar/2$, occur with equal
probability.  In either case, the two-particle state collapses so that
$A$ is in the observed spin eigenstate, and $B$ has the opposite spin.
After the collapse, the two-particle state is no longer entangled.

\section{The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen ``paradox''}

In 1935, \hyperref[cite:epr]{Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR)} used
the counter-intuitive features of quantum entanglement to formulate a
thought experiment known as the \textbf{EPR paradox}.  They tried to
use this thought experiment to argue that quantum theory cannot serve
as a fundamental description of reality.  Subsequently, however, it
was shown that the EPR paradox is not an actual paradox; physical
systems \textit{really do} have the strange behavior that the thought
experiment highlighted.

The EPR paradox begins with an entangled state like this state of two
spin-$1/2$ particles:
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Big(|\!+\!z\rangle|\!-\!z\rangle \,-\, |\!-\!z\rangle|\!+\!z\rangle\Big).
\end{equation}
As before, let the two particles be labeled $A$ and $B$.  Measuring
$S_z$ on $A$ collapses the system into a two-particle state that is
unentangled, where each particle has a definite spin.  If the
measurement outcome is $+\hbar/2$, the new state is $|\!+\!z\rangle
|\!-\!z\rangle$, whereas if the outcome is $-\hbar/2$, the new state
is $|\!-\!z\rangle|\!+\!z\rangle$.

The postulates of quantum theory seem to indicate that the state
collapse happens instantaneously, regardless of the distance
separating the particles.  Imagine that we prepare the two-particle
state in a laboratory, transport particle $A$ to the Alpha Centauri
star system, and transport particle $B$ to the Betelgeuse system,
separated by $\sim 640$ light years.  In principle, this can be done
carefully enough to avoid disturbing the two-particle quantum state.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{epr}
\end{figure}

Once ready, an experimentalist at Alpha Centauri measures $\hat{S}_z$
on particle $A$, which induces an instantaneous collapse of the
two-particle state.  Immediately afterwards, an experimentalist at
Betelgeuse measures $\hat{S}_z$ on particle $B$, and obtains---with
100\% certainty---the opposite spin.  During the time interval between
these two measurements, no classical signal could have traveled
between the two star systems, not even at the speed of light.  Yet
the state collapse induced by the measurement at Alpha Centauri has a
definite effect on the result of the measurement at Betelgeuse.

There are three noteworthy aspects of this phenomenon:

First, it dispels some commonsensical but mistaken ``explanations''
for quantum state collapse in terms of perturbative effects.  For
instance, it is sometimes explained that if we want to measure a
particle's position, we need to shine a light beam on it, or disturb
it in some way, and this disturbance generates an uncertainty in the
particle's momentum.  The EPR paradox shows that such stories don't
capture the full weirdness of quantum state collapse, for we can
collapse the state of a particle by doing a measurement on
\textit{another} particle far away!

Second, the experimentalist has a certain amount of control over the
state collapse, due to the choice of what measurement to perform.  So
far, we have considered $S_z$ measurements performed on particle $A$.
But the experimentalist at Alpha Centauri can choose to measure the
spin of $A$ along another axis, say $S_x$.  In the basis of spin-up
and spin-down states, the operator $\hat{S}_x$ has matrix
representation
\begin{equation}
  \hat{S}_x = \frac{\hbar}{2}\, \begin{pmatrix}0&1\\1&0\end{pmatrix}.
  \end{equation}
The eigenvalues and eigenvectors are
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}s_x = \;\;\frac{\hbar}{2},\; &\;\;\; |\!+\!x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big(|\!+\!z\rangle + |\!-\!z\rangle\Big) \\ s_x = -\frac{\hbar}{2}, &\;\;\; |\!-\!x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big(|\!+\!z\rangle - |\!-\!z\rangle\Big).\end{aligned}
\end{align}
Conversely, we can write the $\hat{S}_z$ eigenstates in the $\{|\!+\!x\rangle,|\!-\!x\rangle\}$ basis:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}|\!+\!z\rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big(|\!+\!x\rangle + |\!-\!x\rangle\Big) \\ |\!-\!z\rangle &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big(|\!+\!x\rangle - |\!-\!x\rangle\Big).\end{aligned}
\end{align}
This allows us to write the two-particle entangled state in the
$\hat{S}_x$ basis:
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Big(|\!-\!x\rangle|\!+\!x\rangle \,-\, |\!+\!x\rangle|\!-\!x\rangle\Big).
\end{equation}
The Alpha Centauri measurement still collapses the particles into
definite spin states with opposite spins---but now spin states of
${S}_x$ rather than ${S}_z$.

Third, this ability to choose the measurement axis \textit{does not}
allow for superluminal communication.  The experimentalist at Alpha
Centauri can choose whether to (i) measure $S_z$ or (ii) measure
$S_x$, and this choice instantaneously affects the quantum state of
particle $B$.  If the Betelgeuse experimentalist can find a way to
distinguish between the cases (i) and (ii), even statistically, this
would serve as a method for instantaneous communication, violating the
theory of relativity!  Yet this turns out to be impossible.  The key
problem is that quantum states themselves cannot be measured; only
observables can be measured.  Suppose the Alpha Centauri measurement
is $\hat{S}_z$, which collapses $B$ to either $|\!+\!z\rangle$ or
$|\!-\!z\rangle$, each with probability $1/2$.  The Betelgeuse
experimentalist must now choose which measurement to perform.  If
$S_z$ is measured, the outcome is $+\hbar/2$ or $-\hbar/2$ with equal
probabilities.  If $S_x$ is measured, the probabilities are:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}P(S_x = +\hbar/2) &= \frac{1}{2}\, \Big|\langle\!+x|\!+\!z\rangle\Big|^2 \;+\;\, \frac{1}{2}\, \Big|\langle\!+x|\!-\!z\rangle\Big|^2 = \frac{1}{2}\\P(S_x = -\hbar/2) &= \frac{1}{2}\, \Big|\langle\!-x|\!+\!z\rangle\Big|^2 \;+\;\, \frac{1}{2}\, \Big|\langle\!-x|\!-\!z\rangle\Big|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.\end{aligned}
\end{align}
The probabilities are still equal!  Repeating this analysis for any
other choice of spin axis, we find that the two possible outcomes
always have equal probability.  Thus, the Betelgeuse measurement does
not yield any information about the choice of measurement axis at
Alpha Centauri.

Since quantum state collapse does not allow for superluminal
communication, it is consistent \textit{in practice} with the theory
of relativity.  However, state collapse is still \textbf{nonlocal}, in
the sense that unobservable ingredients of the theory (quantum states)
can change faster than light can travel between two points.  For this
reason, EPR argued that quantum theory is \textit{philosophically}
inconsistent with relativity.

EPR suggested an alternative: maybe quantum mechanics is an
approximation of some deeper theory, whose details are currently
unknown, but which is deterministic and local.  Such a
``\textbf{hidden variable theory}'' may give the appearance of
quantum state collapse in the following way.  Suppose each particle
has a definite but ``hidden'' value of $S_z$, either $S_z = +\hbar/2$
or $S_z = -\hbar/2$; let us denote these as $[+]$ or $[-]$.  We can
hypothesize that the two-particle quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ is not
an actual description of reality; rather, it corresponds to a
\textit{statistical} distribution of ``hidden variable'' states,
denoted by $[+;-]$ (i.e., $S_z = +\hbar/2$ for particle $A$ and $S_z =
-\hbar/2$ for particle $B$), and $[-;+]$ (the other way around).

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{hiddenvariables}
\end{figure}

When the Alpha Centauri experimentalist measures $S_z$, the value of
the hidden variable is revealed.  A result of $+z$ implies $[+;-]$,
whereas $-z$ implies $[-;+]$.  When the Betelgeuse experimentalist
subsequently measures $S_z$, the result obtained is the opposite of
the Alpha Centauri result.  But those were simply the values all
along---there is no instantaneous physical influence traveling from
Alpha Centauri to Betelguese.

Clearly, there are many missing details in this hypothetical
description.  Any actual hidden variable theory would also need to
replicate the huge list of successful predictions made by quantum
theory.  Trying to come up with a suitable theory of this sort seems
difficult, but with enough hard work, one might imagine that it is
doable.

\section{Bell's theorem}

In 1964, however, John S.~Bell published a
\hyperref[cite:bell]{bombshell paper} showing that the predictions of
quantum theory are \textit{inherently inconsistent} with hidden
variable theories.  The amazing thing about this result, known as
\textbf{Bell's theorem}, is that it requires no knowledge about the
details of the hidden variable theory, just that it is deterministic
and local.  Here, we present a simplified version of Bell's theorem,
based on \hyperref[cite:mermin]{Mermin (1981)}.

We again consider spin-1/2 particle pairs, with particle $A$ sent to
Alpha Centauri and particle $B$ sent to Betelgeuse.  At each location,
an experimentalist can measure the particle's spin along three
distinct choices of spin axis.  These spin observables are denoted by
$S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$.  We will not specify the actual directions of
these spin axes until later in the proof.  For now, just note that the
axes need not correspond to orthogonal spatial directions.

We now repeatedly prepare two-particle systems, and send the particles
to Alpha Centauri and Betelgeuse.  Each time, the prepared
two-particle state is
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Big(|\!+\!z\rangle|\!-\!z\rangle \,-\, |\!-\!z\rangle|\!+\!z\rangle\Big).
\end{equation}
During each round of the experiment, each experimentalist randomly
chooses one of the three spin axes $S_1$, $S_2$, or $S_3$, and
performs that spin measurement.  It doesn't matter which
experimentalist performs the measurement first; the experimentalists
can't influence each other, as there is not enough time for a
light-speed signal to travel between the two locations.  Many rounds
of the experiment are conducted; for each round, both
experimentalists' choices of spin axis are recorded, along with their
measurement results.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.67\textwidth]{bell}
\end{figure}

At the end, the experimental records are brought together and
examined.  We assume that the results are consistent with the
predictions of quantum theory.  Among other things, this means that
whenever the experimentalists happen to choose the same measurement
axis, they always find opposite spins.  (For example, this is the case
during ``Experiment 4'' in the above figure, where both
experimentalists happened to measure $S_3$.)

Can a hidden variable theory reproduce the results predicted by
quantum theory?  In a hidden variable theory, each particle must have
a definite value for each spin observable.  For example, particle $A$
might have $S_1 = +\hbar/2, \, S_2 = +\hbar/2, \, S_3 = -\hbar/2$.
Let us denote this by $[++-]$.  To be consistent with the predictions
of quantum theory, the hidden spin variables for the two particles
must have opposite values along each direction.  This means that there
are $8$ distinct possibilities, which we can denote as
\begin{align*}
  \begin{aligned}{[}{+++};{---}], \;\;\; [{++-};{--+}], \;\;\; [{+-+};{-+-}], \;\;\; [{+--};{-++}],\\ [{-++};{+--}], \;\;\; [{-+-};{+-+}], \;\;\; [{--+};{++-}], \;\;\; [{---};{+++}].\end{aligned}
\end{align*}
For instance, $[{++-};{--+}]$ indicates that for particle $A$, $S_1 =
S_2 = +\hbar/2$ and $S_3 = -\hbar/2$, while particle $B$ has the
opposite spin values, $S_1 = S_2 = -\hbar/2$ and $S_3 = +\hbar/2$.
So far, however, we don't know anything about the relative
probabilities of these 8 cases.

Let's now focus on the subset of experiments in which the two
experimentalists happened to choose \textit{different} spin axes
(e.g., Alpha Centauri chose $S_1$ and Betelgeuse chose $S_2$).  Within
this subset, what is the probability \textit{for the two measurement
  results to have opposite signs} (i.e., one $+$ and one $-$)?  To
answer this question, we first look at the following 6 cases:
\begin{align*}
  \begin{aligned}{[}{++-};{--+}], \;\;\; [{+-+};{-+-}], \;\;\; [{+--};{-++}],\\ [{-++};{+--}], \;\;\; [{-+-};{+-+}], \;\;\; [{--+};{++-}].\end{aligned}
\end{align*}
These are the cases which do not have all $+$ or all $-$ for each
particle.  Consider one of these, say ${[}{++-};{--+}]$.  The two
experimentalists picked their measurement axes at random each time,
and amongst the experiments where they picked different axes, there
are two ways for the measurement results to have opposite signs:
$(S_1,S_2)$ or $(S_2,S_1)$.  There are four ways to get the same sign:
$(S_1,S_3)$, $(S_2,S_3)$, $(S_3,S_1)$ and $(S_3, S_2)$.  Thus,
for this particular set of hidden variables, the probability for
measurement results with opposite signs is 1/3.  If we go through all
6 of the cases listed above, we find that in call cases, the
probability for opposite signs is 1/3.

Now look at the remaining 2 cases:
\begin{equation*}
  {[}{+++};{---}], \;\;\; [{---};{+++}].
\end{equation*}
For these, the experimentalists always obtain results that have
opposite signs.  Combining this with the findings from the previous
paragraph, we obtain the following statement:

\textit{Given that the two experimentalists choose different spin
  axes, the probability that their results have opposite signs is $P
  \ge 1/3$.}

This is called \textbf{Bell's inequality}.  If we can arrange a
situation where quantum theory predicts a probability $P < 1/3$ (i.e.,
a violation of Bell's inequality), that would mean that quantum theory
is inherently inconsistent with local deterministic hidden variables.
This conclusion would hold regardless of the ``inner workings'' of the
hidden variable theory.  In particular, note that the above derivation
made no assumptions about the relative probabilities of the hidden
variable states.

To complete the proof, we must find a set $\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}$ such
that the predictions of quantum mechanics violate Bell's inequality.
One simple choice is to align $S_1$ with the $z$ axis, and align $S_2$
and $S_3$ along the $x$-$z$ plane at $120^\circ$ ($2\pi/3$ radians)
from $S_1$, as shown below:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.28\textwidth]{bellaxes}
\end{figure}

The corresponding spin operators can be written in the eigenbasis of
$\hat{S}_z$:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\hat{S}_1 &= \frac{\hbar}{2} \, \sigma_3 \\ \hat{S}_2 &= \frac{\hbar}{2} \, \left[\cos(2\pi/3) \sigma_3 + \sin(2\pi/3)\sigma_1\right]  \\   \hat{S}_3 &= \frac{\hbar}{2} \, \left[\cos(2\pi/3) \sigma_3 - \sin(2\pi/3)\sigma_1\right].\end{aligned}
\end{align}

Suppose the Alpha Centauri experimentalist chooses $S_1$, and obtains
$+\hbar/2$.  Particle $A$ collapses to state $|\!+\!z\rangle$, and
particle $B$ collapses to state $|\!-\!z\rangle$.  The Betelgeuse
experimentalist is assumed to choose a different spin axis.  If the
choice is $S_2$, the expectation value is
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\langle\, - z \, | \, S_2 \,|-\!z\,\rangle &= \frac{\hbar}{2} \Big[\cos(2\pi/3) \langle\,- z\,|\sigma_3| - \!z\,\rangle + \sin(2\pi/3)\langle\,- z\,|\sigma_1|-\!z\,\rangle\Big]\\ &= \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \end{aligned}
\end{align}
If $P_+$ and $P_-$ respectively denote the probability of measuring
$+\hbar/2$ and $-\hbar/2$ in this measurement, the above equation
implies that $P_+ - P_- = + 1/2$.  Moreover, $P_+ + P_- = 1$ by
probability conservation.  It follows that the probability of
obtaining a negative value (the opposite sign from the Alpha Centauri
measurement) is $P_- = 1/4$.  All the other possible scenarios are
worked out in a similar way.

The result is that if the two experimentalists choose different
measurement axis, they obtain results of opposite signs with
probability $1/4$.  Therefore, Bell's inequality is violated.

Last of all, we must consult Nature itself.  Is it possible to
observe, in an actual experiment, probabilities that violate Bell's
inequality?  In the decades following Bell's 1964 paper, many
experiments were performed to answer this question.  These experiments
are all substantially more complicated than the simple two-particle
spin-$1/2$ model that we've studied, and they are subject to various
uncertainties and ``loopholes'' that are beyond the scope of our
discussion.  But in the end, the experimental consensus appears to be
a clear \textit{yes}: Nature really does behave according to quantum
mechanics, and in a manner that cannot be replicated by deterministic
local hidden variables!  A summary of the experimental evidence can be
found in \hyperref[cite:aspect]{Aspect (1999)}.

\section{Density operators}

We will now introduce a theoretical construct called the
\textbf{density operator}, which helps to streamline many calculations
in multi-particle quantum mechanics.

Consider a quantum system with a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space
$\mathscr{H}$.  Given an arbitrary state $|\psi\rangle \in
\mathscr{H}$, we can define an operator
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho} = |\psi\rangle\, \langle\psi|.
\end{equation}
This is simply the projection operator associated with $|\psi\rangle$,
but in this context we call it a density operator.  (Some authors call
it a \textbf{density matrix}, based on the understanding that
quantum operators can be represented as matrices).

In the language of linear algebra, $\hat{\rho}$ is formed by the
``matrix outer product'' of $|\psi\rangle$ with its Hermitian
conjugate.  It has the following noteworthy features:

\begin{enumerate}
\item It is a Hermitian operator.  Moreover, one eigenvalue is 1 (with
  eigenvector $|\psi\rangle$), and the other $d-1$ eigenvalues are all
  $0$ (the corresponding eigenvectors consist of $d-1$ vectors
  spanning the subspace orthogonal to $|\psi\rangle$).  Thus,
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
    \textrm{All eigenvalues of $\hat{\rho}$ are real numbers in $[0,1]$.} \\
    \textrm{Sum of eigenvalues of $\hat{\rho}$} = \mathrm{Tr}\big[\,\hat{\rho} \,\big] = 1.
  \end{aligned}
  \label{trrho}
\end{align}

\item With the system in state $|\psi\rangle$, suppose we perform a
  measurement corresponding to the Hermitian operator $\hat{Q}$, which
  has eigenvalues $\{q_1,q_2,\dots\}$ and eigenvectors
  $\{|q_1\rangle,|q_2\rangle,\dots\}$.  The probability for outcome
  $q_i$ is $|\langle q_i| \psi\rangle|^2 \;=\; \langle q_i
  |\psi\rangle \langle \psi|q_i\rangle$; thus,
  \begin{equation}
    P(q_i) = \langle q_i |\, \hat{\rho}\, |q_i \rangle.
    \label{Pi_rho}
  \end{equation}

\item The expectation value of the $\hat{Q}$ observable is $\langle
  Q\rangle = \sum_i q_i P(q_i)$, and after a few lines of algebra we
  can show that
  \begin{equation}
    \langle Q\rangle = \mathrm{Tr}\big[\,\hat{Q} \; \hat{\rho}\,\big].
    \label{Qexpt}
  \end{equation}
This is a nice expression, because the trace is a basis-independent
operation, so $\langle Q\rangle$ is explicitly shown to be
basis-independent.
\end{enumerate}

Now, suppose again that the quantum system consists of two particles
(subsystems) $A$ and $B$, with Hilbert spaces $\mathscr{H}_A$ and
$\mathscr{H}_B$, where $\mathscr{H} = \mathscr{H}_A \otimes
\mathscr{H}_B$.  Suppose we are interested in the physical behavior of
$A$---specifically, the expectation values of partial measurements
performed on $A$, the corresponding outcome probabilities, etc.  These
quantities can, of course, be calculated from the overall system state
$|\psi\rangle$, but this might be inconvenient to deal with (e.g., if
$A$ is a relatively simple subsystem but $B$ is large and
complicated).

However, it turns out that there is a way to describe the behavior of
$A$ in its own terms.  This is done by defining a \textbf{reduced
  density operator} for $A$:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_A = \mathrm{Tr}_B \,\big[\,\hat{\rho}\,\big].
  \label{rhoa_def}
\end{equation}
Here, $\mathrm{Tr}_B[\cdots]$ refers to a \textbf{partial trace},
which means tracing over the $\mathscr{H}_B$ part of the Hilbert space
$\mathscr{H} = \mathscr{H}_A \otimes \mathscr{H}_B$.  The partial
trace yields an operator acting on $\mathscr{H}_A$.

To better understand Eq.~\eqref{rhoa_def}, let us work in an explicit
basis.  Let $\{|\mu_1\rangle, |\mu_2\rangle,\cdots\}$ be a basis for
$\mathscr{H}_A$, and $\{|\nu_1\rangle, |\nu_2\rangle,\cdots\}$ be a
basis for $\mathscr{H}_B$.  Any given state of the combined system can
be written in the tensor product basis:
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \sum_{ij} \psi_{ij} \, |\mu_i\rangle  |\nu_j\rangle,
\end{equation}
for some complex coefficients $\psi_{ij}$.  We require $\sum_{ij}
|\psi_{ij}|^2 = 1$ so that $|\psi\rangle$ is normalized to unity.  The
density operator of the combined system is
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho} = |\psi\rangle \langle\psi| = \sum_{ii'jj'} \Big( |\mu_i\rangle  |\nu_j\rangle\Big) \psi_{ij} \psi_{i'j'}^* \, \Big(\langle \mu_{i'}|  \langle \nu_{j'}|\Big).
\end{equation}
The reduced density operator for subsystem $A$ is
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\hat{\rho}_A &= \sum_j \langle \nu_j | \hat{\rho} | \nu_j \rangle \\ &= \sum_{ii'} |\mu_i\rangle \,\rho_{ii'}^A \, \langle \mu_{i'}| \;\;\;\mathrm{where} \;\; \rho_{ii'}^A \equiv \sum_j \psi_{ij} \psi_{i'j}^*.\end{aligned}
  \label{rhoa_explicit}
\end{align}
From this, we see that $\hat{\rho}_A$ is Hermitian.  Moreover, if we
happen to take the $\{|\mu_i\rangle\}$ basis to be the eigenbasis for
$\hat{\rho}_A$, the eigenvalues are $\rho_{ii}^A = \sum_j
|\psi_{ij}|^2$.  We can thus prove that:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
    \textrm{All eigenvalues of $\hat{\rho}_A$ are real numbers in $[0,1]$.} \\
    \textrm{Sum of eigenvalues of $\hat{\rho}_A$} = \mathrm{Tr}\big[\,\hat{\rho}_A \,\big] = 1.
  \end{aligned}
  \label{trrho_reduced}
\end{align}

The reduced density operator contains all the information required to
calculate outcome probabilities for any \textit{partial} measurement
performed on $A$.  Suppose we perform a measurement on $A$
corresponding to a Hermitian operator $\hat{\mu}$.  Without loss of
generality, we can choose the basis
$\{|\mu_1\rangle,|\mu_2\rangle,\dots\}$ to be the eigenvectors of
$\hat{\mu}$.  We claim that the probability of obtaining outcome
$\mu_i$ is
\begin{align}
  P(\mu_i) &= \langle \mu_i | \hat{\rho}_A |\mu_i \rangle \label{Pmui} \\
  &=\, \rho_{ii}^A \,=\, \sum_{j} |\psi_{ij}|^2.
\end{align}
To prove this, recall the rules for partial measurements from
Section~\ref{sec:partialmeasurements}.  The projection operator for
measurement outcome $\mu_i$ is
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\Pi}(\mu_i) = |\mu_i\rangle\langle \mu_i| \otimes \hat{I}.
\end{equation}
Therefore,
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
    P(\mu_i) &= \langle \psi | \hat{\Pi}(\mu_i) \hat{\Pi}(\mu_i) |\psi\rangle \\
    &= \langle \psi | \hat{\Pi}(\mu_i) |\psi\rangle \\
    &= \langle \psi | \Big(|\mu_i\rangle\langle \mu_i| \otimes \hat{I}\Big)
    |\psi\rangle \\
    &= \sum_j \langle \psi | \Big(|\mu_i\rangle\langle \mu_i| \otimes
    |\nu_j\rangle\langle \nu_j|\Big) |\psi\rangle \\
    &= \sum_j \Big(\langle\mu_i|\langle\nu_j|\Big) |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|
    \Big(|\mu_i\rangle |\nu_j\rangle\Big) \\
    &= \langle \mu_i| \;\mathrm{Tr}_B[ \hat{\rho}]\; |\mu_i\rangle \qquad\qquad
    (\textrm{Q.E.D.})
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
It also follows that the expectation value for this measurement is
\begin{equation}
  \langle \mu \rangle =
  \mathrm{Tr}_A \big[\, \hat{\mu} \; \hat{\rho}_A\,\big].
  \label{exptrho_reduced}
\end{equation}

The reduced density operator's properties \eqref{trrho_reduced},
\eqref{Pmui}, and \eqref{exptrho_reduced} are precisely the same as
the original density operator's properties \eqref{trrho},
\eqref{Pi_rho}, \eqref{Qexpt}.  Hence, we deduce that these are the
general properties of any density operator, reduced or not.  The
special class of density operators that can be written in the form
$\hat{\rho} = |\psi\rangle\, \langle\psi|$ (i.e., in terms of an
explicit quantum state, like the one we started this discussion with)
are said to describe \textbf{pure states}.  Density operators that
cannot be written in such a form are said to describe \textbf{mixed
  states}.

A mixed state can also be interpreted as a \textit{probability
  distribution of quantum states}.  To see this, let us return to
Eq.~\eqref{rhoa_explicit}:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}\hat{\rho}_A
    &= \sum_{ii'j} |\mu_i\rangle \, \psi_{ij} \psi_{i'j}^*
    \langle \mu_{i'}| \\
    &= \sum_j |\psi'_j\rangle\langle\psi'_j| \;\;\;\mathrm{where}
    \;\;\; |\psi'_j\rangle \equiv \sum_i \psi_{ij} |\mu_i\rangle.
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
However, the $|\psi'\rangle$ vectors inside the sum are not
normalized.  Re-normalizing them yields the expression
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_A = \sum_j p_j\, |\Psi_j\rangle \langle \Psi_j|
  \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;
  \begin{cases}
    p_j &= \displaystyle \; \langle \psi_j' | \psi_j' \rangle
    \,=\, \sum_i |\psi_{ij}|^2 \\
    |\Psi_j \rangle &= \displaystyle \; \frac{1}{\sqrt{p_j}} |\psi_j'\rangle,
    \;\;\textrm{so}\;\; \langle \Psi_j|\Psi_j \rangle = 1.
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
This is a weighted sum, where each term involves a pure state
$|\Psi_j\rangle \langle \Psi_j|$ and a weight $p_j$.  The $p_j$'s are
real numbers between 0 and 1, and sum to unity, so they can be
regarded as probabilities.  We can therefore interpret $\hat{\rho}_A$
as describing an ``ensemble'' of different quantum systems, weighted
by a set of probabilities $p_j$.

Although this interpretation is highly suggestive, one should not take
it too seriously.  For one thing, the decomposition is not unique: it
is possible to express a given density operator using different
weighted sums, each having a different set of probabilities.  For an
example, see \hyperref[ex:rho_decomp]{Exercise 3}.  Ultimately, the
information about the mixed state is encoded in the mathematical
object $\hat{\rho}_A$ itself, which cannot really be simplified any
further.

\section{Entanglement entropy}
\label{sec:entropy}

Previously, we said that a multi-particle system is entangled if the
individual particles lack definite quantum states.  It would be nice
to make this statement more precise, and in fact physicists have come
up with several different quantitive measures of entanglement.  In
this section, we will describe the most common measure,
\textbf{entanglement entropy}, which is closely related to the entropy
concept from thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and information
theory.

We have seen from the previous section that if a subsystem $A$ is
(possibly) entangled with some other subsystem $B$, the information
required to calculate all partial measurement outcomes on $A$ is
stored within a reduced density operator $\hat{\rho}_A$.  We can use
this to define a quantity called the \textbf{entanglement entropy} of
$A$:
\begin{equation}
  S_{A} = - k_b \, \mathrm{Tr}_A \Big\{ \hat{\rho}_A\, \ln\!\big[\hat{\rho}_A\big]\Big\}.
  \label{entropy}
\end{equation}
In this formula, $\ln[\cdots]$ denotes the logarithm of an operator,
which is the inverse of the exponential: $\ln(\hat{P}) = \hat{Q}
\Rightarrow \exp(\hat{Q}) = \hat{P}$.  The prefactor $k_b$ is
Boltzmann's constant, and ensures that $S_A$ has the same units as
thermodynamic entropy.

The definition of the entanglement entropy is based on an analogy with
the entropy concept from classical thermodynamics, statistical
mechanics and information theory.  In those classical contexts,
entropy is a quantitative measure of uncertainty (i.e, lack of
information) about a system's underlying microscopic state, or
``microstate''.  Suppose a system has $W$ possible microstates that
occur with probabilities $\{p_1, p_2, \dots, p_W\}$, satisfying
$\sum_i p_i = 1$.  Then we define the classical entropy
\begin{equation}
  S_{\mathrm{cl.}} = - k_b \sum_{i=1}^W p_i \ln(p_i).
\end{equation}
In a situation of complete certainty where the system is known to be
in a specific microstate $k$ ($p_i = \delta_{ik}$), the formula gives
$S_{\mathrm{cl.}} = 0$.  (Note that $x \ln(x)\rightarrow 0$ as
$x\rightarrow 0$).  In a situation of complete uncertainty where all
microstates are equally probable ($p_i = 1/W$), we get
$S_{\mathrm{cl.}} = k_b \ln W$, the entropy of a microcanonical
ensemble in statistical mechanics.  For any other distribution of
probabilities, it can be shown that the entropy lies between these two
extremes: $0 \le S_{\mathrm{cl.}}  \le k_b\ln W$.  For a review of the
properties of entropy, see Appendix C.

The concept of entanglement entropy aims to quantify the uncertainty
arising from a quantum (sub)system's lack of a definite quantum state,
due to it being possibly entangled with another (sub)system.  When
formulating it, the key issue we need to be careful about is how to
extend classical notions of probability to quantum systems.  We have
seen that when performing a measurement on $A$ whose possible outcomes
are $\{\mu_1, \mu_2, \dots\}$, the probability of getting $\mu_i$ is
$p_i = \langle \mu_i | \hat{\rho}_A|\mu_i\rangle$.  However, it is
problematic to directly substitute these probabilities $\{p_i\}$ into
the classical entropy formula, since they are basis-dependent (i.e.,
the set of probabilities is dependent on the choice of measurement).
Eq.~\eqref{entropy} bypasses this problem by using the trace, which is
basis-independent.

In the special case where $\{|\mu_i\rangle\}$ is the eigenbasis for
$\hat{\rho}_A$, the connection is easier to see.  From
\eqref{trrho_reduced}, the eigenvalues $\{p_i\}$ are all real numbers
between 0 and 1, and summing to unity, so they can be regarded as
probabilities.  Then the entanglement entropy is
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}S_A &= -k_b \sum_i \langle \mu_i | \hat{\rho}_A \ln(\hat{\rho}_A) | \mu_i\rangle  \\ &= - k_b \sum_i p_i \ln(p_i).
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
Therefore, in this particular basis the expression for the
entanglement entropy is consistent with the classical definition of
entropy, with the eigenvalues of $\hat{\rho}_A$ serving as the
relevant probabilities.

By analogy with the classical entropy formula (see Appendix C), the
entanglement entropy has the following bounds:
\begin{equation}
  0 \le S_A \le k_b\ln(d_A),
  \label{Sabounds}
\end{equation}
where $d_A$ is the dimension of $\mathscr{H}_A$.

For an unentangled system---i.e., a pure state---we can write
$\hat{\rho} = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|$ for some state $|\psi\rangle$.
In this case, $|\psi\rangle$ is itself an eigenstate of $\hat{\rho}$
with eigenvalue 1, so $S_{A} = 0$.  This corresponds to the lower
bound of \eqref{Sabounds}.  Conversely, if we find that a system has
$S_{A} \ne 0$, that implies that $\hat{\rho}_A$ cannot be written as a
pure state $|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|$ for \textit{any} $|\psi\rangle$;
hence, it must be entangled---i.e., $\hat{\rho}_A$ must describe a
mixed state.

A system is said to be \textbf{maximally entangled} if it saturates
the upper bound of \eqref{Sabounds}, $S_A = k_b \ln(d_A)$.  This
occurs if and only if the eigenvalues of the density operator are all
equal: i.e., $p_i = 1/d_A$ for all $i = 1, \dots, d_A$.

As an example, consider the following state of two spin-$1/2$ particles:
\begin{align}
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \Big(|\!+\!z\rangle|\!-\!z\rangle \,-\, |\!-\!z\rangle|\!+\!z\rangle\Big).
\end{align}
The density operator for the two-particle system is
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}(\psi) = \frac{1}{2} \Big(|\!+\!z\rangle|\!-\!z\rangle \,-\, |\!-\!z\rangle|\!+\!z\rangle\Big) \Big(\langle+z|\langle-z| \,-\, \langle-z|\langle+z|\Big).
\end{equation}
Tracing over subsystem $B$ gives the reduced density operator
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_A(\psi) = \frac{1}{2} \Big(|\!+\!z\rangle \langle+z| \,+\, |\!-\!z\rangle \langle-z|\Big).
\end{equation}
This can be expressed as a matrix in the
$\{|\!+z\rangle,|\!-z\rangle\}$ basis:
\begin{equation}
  \hat{\rho}_A(\psi) = \begin{pmatrix}\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2}\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Next, we can use $\hat{\rho}_A$ to compute the entropy of subsystem $A$:
\begin{equation}
  S_A = -k_b\mathrm{Tr}\left\{\hat{\rho}_A\ln(\rho_A)\right\} = -k_b\mathrm{Tr}\begin{pmatrix}\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\end{pmatrix} = k_b\ln(2).
\end{equation}
Hence, subsystems $A$ and $B$ are maximally entangled.

\section{The Many Worlds Interpretation}

We conclude this chapter by discussing a set of compelling but
controversial ideas arising from the phenomenon of quantum
entanglement: the \textbf{Many Worlds Interpretation} as formulated by
\hyperref[cite:everett]{Hugh Everett (1956)}.

So far, when describing the phenomenon of state collapse, we have
relied on the measurement postulate (see
Section~\ref{sec:partialmeasurements}), which is part of the
\textbf{Copenhagen Interpretation} of quantum mechanics.  This is how
quantum mechanics is typically taught, and how physicists think about
the theory when doing practical, everyday calculations.

However, the measurement postulate has two bad features:

\begin{enumerate}
\item It stands apart from the other postulates of quantum mechanics,
  for it is the only place where randomness (or ``indeterminism'')
  creeps into quantum theory.  The other postulates do not refer to
  probabilities.  In particular, the Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}
  i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}|\psi(t)\rangle = \hat{H}(t) |\psi(t)\rangle
\end{equation}
is completely deterministic.  If you know $\hat{H}(t)$ and are given
the state $|\psi(t_0)\rangle$ at some time $t_0$, you can in principle
determine $|\psi(t)\rangle$ for all $t$.  This time-evolution consists
of a smooth, non-random rotation of the state vector within its
Hilbert space.  A measurement process, however, has a completely
different character: it causes the state vector to jump
discontinuously to a randomly-selected value.  It is strange that
quantum theory contains two completely different ways for a state to
change.

\item The measurement postulate is silent on what constitutes a
measurement.  Does measurement require a conscious observer?  Surely
not: as Einstein once exasperatedly asked, are we really expected to
believe that the Moon exists only when we look at it?  But if a given
device interacts with a particle, what determines whether it acts via
the Schr\"odinger equation, or performs a measurement?
\end{enumerate}

The Many Worlds Interpretation seeks to resolve these problems by
positing that \textit{the measurement postulate is \underline{not} a
  fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics}.  Rather, what we call
``measurement'', including state collapse and the apparent randomness
of measurement results, is an emergent phenomenon that can be derived
from the behavior of complex many-particle quantum systems obeying the
Schr\"odinger equation.  The key idea is that a measurement process
can be described by applying the Schr\"odinger equation to a quantum
system containing both the thing being measured \textit{and} the
measurement apparatus itself.

We can study this using a toy model formulated by
\hyperref[cite:albrecht]{Albrecht (1993)}.  Consider a spin-$1/2$
particle, and an apparatus designed to measure $S_z$.  Let
$\mathscr{H}_S$ be the spin-$1/2$ Hilbert space (which is 2D), and
$\mathscr{H}_A$ be the Hilbert space of the apparatus (which has
dimension $d$).  We will assume that $d$ is very large, as actual
experimental apparatuses are macroscopic objects containing $10^{23}$
or more atoms!  The Hilbert space of the combined system is
\begin{equation}
  \mathscr{H} = \mathscr{H}_S \otimes \mathscr{H}_A,
\end{equation}
and is $2d$-dimensional.  Let us suppose the system is prepared in an initial
state
\begin{equation}
  |\psi(0)\rangle = \Big(a_+ |\!+z\rangle + a_- |\!-z\rangle\Big) \otimes |\Psi\rangle,
\end{equation}
where $a_\pm\in\mathbb{C}$ are the quantum amplitudes for the particle
to be initially spin-up or spin-down, and $|\Psi\rangle \in
\mathscr{H}_A$ is the initial state of the apparatus.

The combined system now evolves via the Schr\"odinger equation.  We
aim to show that if the Hamiltonian has the form
\begin{equation}
  \hat{H} = \hat{S}_z \otimes \hat{V},
\end{equation}
where $\hat{S}_z$ is the operator corresponding to the observable
$S_z$, then time evolution has an effect equivalent to the measurement
of $S_z$.

It turns out that we can show this without making any special choices
for $\hat{V}$ or $|\Psi\rangle$.  We only need $d \gg 2$, and for both
$\hat{V}$ and $|\Psi\rangle$ to be ``sufficiently complicated''.  We
choose $|\Psi\rangle$ to be a random state vector, and choose random
matrix components for the operator $\hat{V}$.  The precise generation
procedures will be elaborated on later.  Once we decide on
$|\Psi\rangle$ and $\hat{V}$, we can evolve the system by solving the
Sch\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}
  |\psi(t)\rangle = U(t)|\psi(0)\rangle, \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\; \hat{U}(t) = \exp\left[-\frac{i}{\hbar}\hat{H}t\right].
\end{equation}
Because the part of $\hat{H}$ acting on the $\mathscr{H}_S$ subspace
is $\hat{S}_z$, the result necessarily has the following form:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}|\psi(t)\rangle &= \hat{U}(t)\Big(a_+ |\!+\!z\rangle + a_- |\!-\!z\rangle\Big) \otimes |\Psi\rangle \\ &= a_+ |\!+\!z\rangle \otimes |\Psi_+(t)\rangle \;+\; a_- |\!-\!z\rangle \otimes |\Psi_-(t)\rangle. \end{aligned}
\end{align}
Here, $|\Psi_+(t)\rangle$ and $|\Psi_-(t)\rangle$ are apparatus states
that are ``paired up'' with the $|\!+\!z\rangle$ and $|\!-\!z\rangle$
states of the spin-$1/2$ subsystem.  At $t=0$, both
$|\Psi_+(t)\rangle$ and $|\Psi_-(t)\rangle$ are equal to
$|\Psi\rangle$; for $t > 0$, they rotate into different parts of the
state space $\mathscr{H}_A$.  If the dimensionality of $\mathscr{H}_A$
is sufficiently large, and both $\hat{V}$ and $|\Psi\rangle$ are
sufficiently complicated, we can guess (and we will verify numerically) that
the two state vectors rotate into completely different parts of
the state space, so that
\begin{equation}
  \langle\Psi_+(t) | \Psi_-(t)\rangle \approx 0 \;\;\;\textrm{for sufficiently large}\;\; t.
\end{equation}
Once this is the case, the two terms in the above expression for
$|\psi(t)\rangle$ can be interpreted as two decoupled ``worlds''.  In
one world, the spin has a definite value $+\hbar/2$, and the apparatus
is in a state $|\Psi_+\rangle$ (which might describe, for instance, a
macroscopically-sized physical pointer that is pointing to a ``$S_z =
+\hbar/2$'' reading).  In the other world, the spin has a definite
value $-\hbar/2$, and the apparatus has a different state
$|\Psi_-\rangle$ (which might describe a physical pointer pointing to
a ``$S_z = -\hbar/2$'' reading).  Importantly, the $|\Psi_+\rangle$
and $|\Psi_-\rangle$ states are orthogonal, so they can be rigorously
distinguished from each other.  The two worlds are
``weighted'' by $|a_+|^2$ and $|a_-|^2$, which correspond to the
probabilities of the two possible measurement results.

The above description can be tested numerically.  Let us use an
arbitrary basis for the apparatus space $\mathscr{H}_A$; in that
basis, let the $d$ components of the initial apparatus state vector
$|\Psi\rangle$ be random complex numbers:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}
  |\Psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mathcal{N}}}\, \begin{pmatrix}\Psi_0 \\ \Psi_1 \\ \vdots \\ \Psi_{d-1}
  \end{pmatrix}, \;\; \mathrm{where} \;\; \mathrm{Re}(\Psi_j), \mathrm{Im}(\Psi_j) \sim N(0,1).
  \end{aligned}
\end{align}
In other words, the real and imaginary parts of each complex number
$\Psi_j$ are independently drawn from the the standard normal
(Gaussian) distribution, denoted by $N(0,1)$.  The normalization
constant $\mathcal{N}$ is defined so that $\langle\Psi|\Psi\rangle =
1$.

Likewise, we generate the matrix elements of $\hat{V}$ according to
the following random scheme:
\begin{align}
  \begin{aligned}A_{ij} &\sim u_{ij} + i v_{ij}, \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;u_{ij},v_{ij}\sim N(0,1)\\ \hat{V} &= \frac{1}{2\sqrt{d}} \left(\hat{A} + \hat{A}^\dagger\right).\end{aligned}
\end{align}
This scheme produces a $d\times d$ matrix with random components,
subject to the requirement that the overall matrix be Hermitian.  The
normalization factor $1/2\sqrt{d}$ is relatively unimportant; it
ensures that the eigenvalues of $\hat{V}$ lie in a fixed range,
$[-2,2]$, instead of scaling with $d$.  If you are interested in
learning more about the properties of such ``random matrices'', see
\hyperref[cite:edelman]{Edelman and Rao (2005)}.

The Schr\"odinger equation can now be solved numerically.  The results
are shown below:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{decoherence}
\end{figure}

In the inital state, we let $a_+ = 0.7$, so $a_- = \sqrt{1-0.7^2} =
0.71414\dots$ The upper panel plots the overlap between the two
apparatus states, $|\langle\Psi_+|\Psi_-\rangle|^2$, versus $t$.  In
accordance with the preceding discussion, the overlap is unity at $t =
0$, but subsequently decreases to nearly zero.  For comparison, the
lower panel plots the entanglement entropy between the two subsystems,
$S_A = -k_b \mathrm{Tr}_A\left\{\hat{\rho}_A\ln\hat{\rho}_A\right\}$,
where $\hat{\rho}_A$ is the reduced density matrix obtained by tracing
over the spin subspace.  We find that $S_A = 0$ at $t=0$, due to the
fact that the spin and apparatus subsystems start out with definite
quantum states in $|\psi(0)\rangle$.  As the system evolves, the
subsystems become increasingly entangled, and $S_A$ increases up to
\begin{equation}
  S_A^{\mathrm{max}}/k_b = - \Big( |a_+|^2 \ln|a_+|^2 + |a_-|^2\ln|a_-|^2 \Big) \approx 0.693
\end{equation}
This value is indicated in the figure by a horizontal dashed line, and
corresponds to the result of the classical entropy formula for
probabilities $\{|a_+|^2,|a_-|^2\}$.  Moreover, we see that the
entropy reaches $S_A^{\mathrm{max}}$ at around the same time that
$|\langle\Psi_+|\Psi_-\rangle|^2$ reaches zero.  This demonstrates the
close relationship between ``measurement'' and ``entanglement''.

For details about the numerical linear algebra methods used to perform
the above calculation, refer to Appendix D.

The ``many worlds'' concept can be generalized from the above toy
model to the universe as a whole.  In the viewpoint of the Many Worlds
Interpretation of quantum mechanics, the entire universe can be
described by a mind-bogglingly complicated quantum state, evolving
deterministically according to the Schr\"odinger equation.  This
evolution involves repeated ``branchings'' of the universal quantum
state, which continuously produces more and more worlds.  The
classical world that we appear to inhabit is just one of a vast
multitude.  It is up to you to decide whether this conception of
reality seems reasonable.  It is essentially a matter of preference,
because the Copenhangen Interpretation and the Many Worlds
Interpretation have identical physical consequences, which is why they
are referred to as different ``interpretations'' of quantum mechanics,
rather than different theories.




\section*{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $\mathscr{H}_A$ and $\mathscr{H}_B$ denote single-particle
  Hilbert spaces with well-defined inner products.  That is to say,
  for all vectors $|\mu\rangle, |\mu'\rangle, |\mu''\rangle \in
  \mathscr{H}_A$, that Hilbert space's inner product satisfies the
  inner product axioms
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\langle \mu|\mu' \rangle = \langle\mu'|\mu\rangle^*$
  \item $\langle \mu|\mu \rangle \in \mathbb{R}^+_0$, and $\langle \mu|\mu \rangle = 0$ if and only if $|\mu\rangle = 0$.
  \item $\langle\mu| \, \big(|\mu'\rangle + |\mu'' \rangle\big)
    = \langle \mu|\mu'\rangle + \langle \mu|\mu''\rangle$
  \item $\langle \mu | \,\big(c|\mu'\rangle\big) = c\langle\mu|\mu'\rangle$ for all $c\in\mathbb{C}$,
  \end{enumerate}
  and likewise for vectors from $\mathscr{H}_B$ with that Hilbert
  space's inner product.

  In Section~\ref{sec:tensorprod}, we defined a tensor product space
  $\mathscr{H}_A\otimes\mathscr{H}_B$ as the space spanned by the
  basis vectors $\{|\mu_i\rangle\otimes|\nu_j\rangle\}$, where
  $|\mu_i\rangle$ are basis vectors for $\mathscr{H}_A$ and
  $|\nu_j\rangle$ are basis vectors for $\mathscr{H}_B$.  Prove that
  we can define an inner product using
  \begin{equation}
    \Big(\langle\mu_i| \otimes \langle\nu_j| \Big) \Big(|\mu_p\rangle \otimes |\nu_q\rangle\Big) \;\equiv\; \langle\mu_i|\mu_p\rangle \, \langle\nu_j|\nu_q\rangle = \delta_{ip}\delta_{jq}
  \end{equation}
  which satisfies the inner product axioms.
  \label{ex:innerprod}

\item Consider the density operator
  \begin{equation}
    \hat{\rho} = \frac{1}{2} |\!+\!z\rangle \langle+z|
    \,+\, \frac{1}{2} |\!+\!x\rangle \langle+x|
  \end{equation}
  where $|\!+\!x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(|\!+\!z\rangle +
  |\!-\!z\rangle\right)$.  This can be viewed as an equal-probability
  sum of two different pure states.  However, the density matrix can
  also be written as
  \begin{equation}
    \hat{\rho} \,=\, p_1\, |\psi_1\rangle \langle \psi_1|
    \,+\, p_2\, |\psi_2\rangle \langle\psi_2|
  \end{equation}
  where $|\psi_{1,2}\rangle$ are the eigenvectors of $\hat{\rho}$.
  Show that $p_1$ and $p_2$ are \textit{not} 1/2.
  \label{ex:rho_decomp}


\item 
  Consider two distinguishable particles, $A$ and $B$.  The 2D Hilbert
  space of $A$ is spanned by $\{|\mu\rangle, |\nu\rangle\}$, and the
  3D Hilbert space of $B$ is spanned by $\{|p\rangle, |q\rangle,
  |r\rangle\}$.  The two-particle state is
\begin{equation}
  |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{3} \, |\mu\rangle|p\rangle
+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \, |\mu\rangle|q\rangle
+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{18}} \, |\mu\rangle|r\rangle
+ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3} \, |\nu\rangle|p\rangle
+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \, |\nu\rangle|q\rangle
+ \frac{1}{3} \, |\nu\rangle|r\rangle.
\end{equation}
Find the entanglement entropy.
