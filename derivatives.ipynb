    "A differential equation is an equation involving several different derivatives of a function.  For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{df}{dx} = \\kappa f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "involves both $f(x)$ and its first derivative.  Specifically, this is an **ordinary differential equation**, because $f(x)$ is a function involving a single input number $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no single fixed procedure for solving differential equations.  In some cases, we can guess the solution: for example, we might happen to know that the above differential equation has solutions of the form\n",
    "\n",
    ": $f(x) = A \\exp(\\kappa x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are methods, such as [Green's functions](greenfunctions.ipynb), for generating solutions to certain special classes of differential equation.  But many differential equations simply cannot be solved analytically, and can only be solved numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "When confronted with an ordinary differential equation, typically the first thing you should look for is the order of the highest derivative appearing in the equation (this is also called the **order** of the differential equation).  If the equation has order $N$, then its **general solution** contains $N$ independent parameters, or \"constants of integration\".  If you happen to be able to guess a solution to the equation, but that solution does not contain $N$ parameters, then you know that your solution isn't the most general one.  In the above example, the order is one; we guessed the solution $f(x) = A \\exp(x)$, which has one parameter $A$.  So we know our work is done: there is no solution more general than the one we found.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **specific solution** to a differential equation is a solution in which there are no independent parameters.  This can be done by assigning numerical values to the independent parameters of the general solution.  These numerical values are often specified in terms of \"boundary conditions\".  For example, for a second-order differential equation, I might give you $f(x = 0)$ and $f'(x = 0)$, and ask you to find the corresponding specific solution.  Alternatively, I could give you $f(x = 0)$ and $f(x = 1)$, or any other combination of two conditions.  For an ordinary differential equation of order $N$, we need $N$ boundary conditions to arrive at a specific solution.\n",
