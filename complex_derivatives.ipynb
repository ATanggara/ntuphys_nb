The above definition does not specify the [[Complex numbers#Polar representation|argument]] of the  complex number (i.e., the direction in the complex plane in which it's pointing, as illustrated in Fig. 1).  In principle, we might get different results from the above formula when we plug in different infinitesimals $\\delta z$, even in the limit where $\\delta z \\rightarrow 0$ and even though $f(z)$ is continuous.\n",

    "## Analytic functions\n",
    "\n",
    "If a function $f(z)$ is complex differentiable for all points $z$ lying in some domain $D\\subset \\mathbb{C}$, then $f(z)$ is said to be **analytic** in $D$ . The concepts of analyticity and complex differentiability are, obviously, closely-related. It's mostly a matter of terminology: complex differentiability is stated with respect to a ''point'' (e.g., we say that a function is complex-differentiable ''at'' a certain point $z$), whereas analyticity is stated with respect to a ''domain'' (e.g., we say that a function is analytic ''in'' a certain subset of $\\mathbb{C}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "A function's domain of analyticity is usually described spatially, in terms of [[Complex numbers#The complex plane|sub-regions of the complex plane]].  For example, a function might be analytic \"everywhere in the complex plane\", which means the entire domain $\\mathbb{C}$.  Or a function might be analytic \"in the upper half of the complex plane\", meaning for all $z$ such that $\\mathrm{Im}(z) > 0$.  Or a function might be analytic \"everywhere except at the point $z = 0$\".  And so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common analytic functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The condition of analyticity can be pretty restrictive; for example, we saw in a [[#example2|previous example]] that $f(z) = z^*$ is not analytic anywhere.  However, there is a large and important class of functions which are analytic over the entire complex plane, except possibly for a discrete set of points.  These are functions generated from formulas which involve $z$ in some \"simple\" combination of algebra operations (addition, multiplication, and integer powers), and which do not involve $z^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we have [[#example1|already shown]] that the function $f(z) = z$ is analytic over the entire complex plane.  Similarly, $f(z) = \\alpha z + \\beta$, where $\\alpha, \\beta$ are complex constants, is analytic everywhere:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}f'(z) &= \\lim_{\\delta z\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{[\\alpha\\,(z+\\delta z) + \\beta] - [\\alpha z + \\beta]}{\\delta z} \\\\&= \\lim_{\\delta z\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\alpha \\delta z}{\\delta z} \\\\&= \\alpha.\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also show that $f(z) = z^n$, with $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, is analytic everywhere in $\\mathbb{C}$:\n",

Likewise, functions that are defined in terms of power series, including the complex [[Mathematical functions#Exponential and logarithm|exponential function]] and [[Mathematical functions#Trigonometric functions|sine/cosine functions]], are analytic everywhere in  $\\mathbb{C}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions involving reciprocals (negative integer powers), such as $f(z) = z^{-1}$ or $f(z) = z^{-2}$, are analytic everywhere ''except'' at points where $f(z)$ becomes singular (i.e., the denominator goes to zero).  The best way to prove this fact is to use the [[#Cauchy-Riemann equations|Cauchy-Riemann equations]], which we'll discuss shortly.\n",

    "More generally, whenever a function involves $z$ in some combination of integer polynomials, reciprocals, or functions with power series expansions&mdash;and does not involve $z^*$ in some irreducible way&mdash;then the function is analytic everywhere except at the singular points.

    "In the [[#Complex continuity and differentiability|preceding sections]], we introduced the notion of a complex derivative as a complex ratio whose value is independent of the direction of an infinitesimal displacement $\\delta z$.

    "# Similarly, for the complex outputs of $f(z)$, the real and imaginary parts cannot be regarded as independent.  If I tell you how the real part of the output varies, by giving you $\\partial u/\\partial x$ and $\\partial u/\\partial y$, then you can work out how the imaginary part of the output varies, by using the Cauchy-Riemann equations to find $\\partial v/\\partial x$ and $\\partial v/\\partial y$.\n",
