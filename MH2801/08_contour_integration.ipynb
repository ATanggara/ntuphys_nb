    "# 8. Contour Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contour integration** is a powerful technique, based on complex analysis, that allows us to solve certain integrals that would otherwise be hard or impossible to solve.  Contour integrals have important applications in many areas of physics, particularly in the study of waves and oscillations. We will see these applications later, when discussing [Fourier transforms](09_fourier_transform.ipynb) and [Green's functions](10_greens_function.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contour integrals\n",
    "\n",
    "We have previously studied what it means to [take the integral of a real function](02_integrals.ipynb). To recap: if $f(x)$ is a real function, the integral from $x=a$ to $x=b$ is defined by dividing the interval into $N$ segments, and evaluating the sum of $f(x)\\Delta x$ on each segment, in the limit where $N$ goes to infinity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_a^b dx\\; f(x) \\;=\\; \\lim_{N \\rightarrow 0} \\, \\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\Delta x\\; f(x_n), \\;\\;\\;\\mathrm{where}\\;\\;\\;x_n = a + n\\Delta x, \\;\\;\\Delta x = \\frac{b-a}{N}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider the case where $f$ is a complex function of a complex variable. A straightfoward way to define the integral of $f(z)$ is to adopt an analogous expression like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lim_{N \\rightarrow 0} \\, \\sum_{n=0}^{N} \\Delta z\\; f(z_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's a conceptual snag: since $f$ takes complex inputs, the values of $z_n$ need not lie along the real line.  In general, the complex numbers $z_n$ form a set of points in the [complex plane](03_complex_numbers.ipynb#complex_plane).  To accomodate this, we can imagine chaining together a sequence of points $z_1, z_2, \\dots, z_N$, which are separated by displacements $\\Delta z_1, \\Delta z_2, \\Delta z_3, \\dots, \\Delta z_{N-1}$, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/complex_integral.png\" alt=\"Definition of a contour in the complex plane.\">\n",

    "\n",
    "Suppose we take the limit $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, so that each displacement $\\Delta z_{n}$ becomes infinitesimal. Then the sequence of points $\\{z_1, z_2, \\dots, z_N\\}$ turns into a continuous trajectory in the complex plane. Such a trajectory is called a **contour**, and can be denoted by an abstract symbol, such as $\\Gamma$. Now we can define a **contour integral** over $\\Gamma$, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_\\Gamma \\, f(z)\\, dz = \\lim_{N \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sum_{n=1}^{N-1} \\Delta z_n\\; f(z_n).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The symbol $\\Gamma$ in the subscript of the integral sign indicates that the integral is to take place over the contour $\\Gamma$. It is always necessary, when defining a contour integral, to specify the contour to integrate over.  This is roughly analogous to how we need to specify the ends of the integration range, in order to properly define a real [definite integral](02_integrals.ipynb). In the complex case, we must specify not just two numbers, but an entire contour.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the contour $\\Gamma$ specifies a direction.  In fact, if we integrate along the same curve in the opposite direction, the value of the contour integral switches sign."

    "In other words, if the factor of $g(z)$ in the integrand does not blow up along the arc contour (i.e., its value is bounded), then in the limit where the bounding value goes to zero, the value of the entire integral vanishes. Usually, the limiting case of interest is when $R$, the radius of the arc contour, goes to infinity. In this situation, the fact that $I$ vanishes is not an obvious result, since we're integrating along an arc of infinite circumference. Jordan's lemma is useful because it tells us that when the above preconditions are satisfied, the integrand vanishes faster than the arc length goes to infinity, so that the overall value of the integral goes to zero.\n",
