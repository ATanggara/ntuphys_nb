    "# 5. Complex Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex numbers are extremely useful for describing the propagation of waves. This includes electromagnetic waves (radio waves, visible light, X-rays, etc.), sound waves, quantum mechanical wavefunctions, and more. It is therefore very important for physicists to have a good understanding of the complex description of wave phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The wave equation\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe wave propagation in space and time, we use a [partial differential equation](01_derivatives.ipynb#PDE) (PDE) known as the **time-dependent wave equation**.  For simplicity, we restrict our attention to a single spatial coordinate, denoted $x$.  The time coordinate is denoted $t$. We describe a wave using a function $f(x,t)$, called the **wavefunction**, which specifies the value of some measurable physical quantity at each position $x$ and time $t$.  For instance, for a sound wave $f(x,t)$ stands for the pressure of the air at that position and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time-independent wave equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{1}{v^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial t^2}, \\;\\;\\; v \\in\\mathbb{R}^+.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $v$, which we currently assume to be a positive real constant, is called the **wave speed**.  The reason for this will shortly become clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "For neatness, we sometimes write the wave equation by putting everything on one side:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{1}{v^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2}\\right) \\; f(x,t) = 0.$$"

But we'll simply deal in terms of $\\omega$ rather than $f$, and call $\\omega$ the frequency.)  By convention, we usually take $\\omega > 0$.
