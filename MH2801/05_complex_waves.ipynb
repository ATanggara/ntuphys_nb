    "# 5. Complex Waves\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as complex numbers provide a convenient way to study oscillations, they can also be employed to model wave motion. In physics, complex numbers are commonly used in the study of electromagnetic (light) waves, sound waves, and other kinds of waves.\n",

    "## The wave equation\n",
    "\n",
    "A wave can be described by a function $f(x,t)$, called a **wavefunction**, which specifies the value of a measurable physical quantity at each position $x$ and time $t$. For simplicity, we will assume that space is one-dimensional, so $x$ is a single real number. We will also assume that $f(x,t)$ is a number, rather than a more complicated object such as a vector. For instance, a sound wave can be described by a wavefunction $f(x,t)$ representing the air pressure at each point of space and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evolution of the wavefunction is described by a [partial differential equation](01_derivatives.ipynb#PDE) (PDE) called the **time-dependent wave equation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{1}{v^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial t^2}, \\;\\;\\; v \\in\\mathbb{R}^+.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $v$, which we take to be a positive real constant, is called the **wave speed**, for reasons that will shortly become clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, we re-arrange the wave equation into the following form, consisting of a linear differential operator acting on $f(x,t)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{1}{v^2} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2}\\right) \\; f(x,t) = 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This way of writing the wave equation emphasizes that it is a linear PDE, meaning that any linear superposition of solutions is likewise a solution."

If, together with this time shift, we change $x$ by $\\delta x = (\\omega/k)\\, \\delta t$, then the change in the $kx$ term and the change in the $\\omega t$ term cancel, leaving the value of the cosine unchanged:\n",
