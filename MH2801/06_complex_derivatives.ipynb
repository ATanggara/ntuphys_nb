Show that the function is complex differentiable at that point.  Hint: consider an arbitary displacement $\\Delta z = \\Delta x + i \\Delta y$.</li>\n",
    "<li>Prove that products of analytic functions are analytic: if $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are analytic in $D \\subset \\mathbb{C}$, then $f(z) g(z)$ is analytic in $D$.</li>\n",
