    "The value of a definite integral depends only on the integrand, and the two integration bounds. The variable which is integrated over is a \"dummy\" variable, in that changing its symbol does not affect the value of the definite integral itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_a^b dx\\; f(x) = \\int_a^b dy\\; f(y).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, since the value of the integral does not depend on the dummy variable, it is nonsensical to write something like\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dx}\\; \\left[\\int_a^b dx\\; f(x)\\right]. \\;\\;\\;(\\text{Nonsense expression}!)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because an integral is defined as the limiting form of a sum, it can be algebraically manipulated in the same way as a summation expression.  For instance, when we have a linear combination of two integrals *with the same bounds*, the linear combination can be brought inside the integral:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$c_1 \\int_{a}^{b} dx \\; f_1(x)\\;\\, +\\;\\, c_2 \\int_{a}^{b} dx\\; f_2(x) = \\int_a^b dx \\;\\Big[c_1 \\,f_1(x) + c_2\\, f_2(x)\\Big].$$\n",

    "\n",
    "For a similar reason, multiple integrals can be manipulated like multiple summations.  If we have a double integral where both integrals have independent bounds, we can swap the order of the integrals:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\int_{a_1}^{b_1} dx_1 \\int_{a_2}^{b_2} dx_2 \\;\\; f(x_1, x_2) = \\int_{a_2}^{b_2} dx_2 \\int_{a_1}^{b_1} dx_1 \\;\\; f(x_1, x_2).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is analogous to how we can swap the order of two independent summations.  Note, however, that this requires the integrals to have independent bounds.

    "$$ \\frac{d}{db} \\left[\\int_a^b dx\\; f(x)\\right] = f(b), \\quad \\frac{d}{da} \\left[\\int_a^b dx\\; f(x)\\right] = -f(a).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove the first equation, observe that increasing the upper bound from $b$ to $b + \\delta b$ increases the area under the curve by $f(b) \\delta b$ (to lowest order in $\\delta b$).  Hence, the definite integral's rate of change with $b$ is $f(b)$.  Likewise, increasing the lower bound from $a$ to $\\delta a$ will *decrease* the area under the curve, leading to a rate of change of $-f(a)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the above result, we can define the concept of an **indefinite integral**, or **antiderivative**, as the \"inverse\" of a derivative operation:\n",

    "\n",
    "Since derivatives are not one-to-one (i.e., two different functions can have the same derivative), an antiderivative does not have a unique, well-specified value; its value is only defined up to an additive constant, called an **integration constant**. A definite integral, by contrast, always has a well-defined value.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you may recall from previous math classes, finding antiderivatives is much harder than differentiation.  Once you know how to differentiate a few special functions, differentiating some combination of those functions just involves a straightforward (though possibly tedious) application of [composition rules](01_derivatives.ipynb#composition_rules).  By contrast, there is no general systematic procedure for symbolic integration.  Integration often involves making a series of inspired choices, like guessing a solution and checking if its derivative gives the desired integral expression. Some of the most common and useful techniques are summarized in the following sections."

Integrating by parts lets us replace one of these factors with its antiderivative, while applying an additional derivative on the other factor.
