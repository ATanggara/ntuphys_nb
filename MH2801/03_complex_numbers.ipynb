    "## Why complex numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers and real numbers have intuitive connections to the phenomena we experience in everyday life, such as the counting of discrete objects, or measuring lengths and weights. By contrast, complex numbers seem to be a mathematical abstraction that has little to do with the physical world. Why should we study them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is another related question that might have occurred to you: if we extend the concept of numbers to complex numbers, why stop here?  Could we usefully extend the concept further, and formulate other abstract number systems that are even more complicated?\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer these questions, let's return to our earlier observation that complex numbers can be manipulated using the same rules of algebra as real numbers. We can use them to add, subtract, multiply, and divide (apart from division by zero), without running into any logical inconsistencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex algebra does, however, lack one important feature of real algebra: it only handles *equations*, not *inequality relations*. Real numbers have a property called \"ordering\", meaning that for any two real numbers $a$ and $b$, one and only one of the following is true:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a < b \\;\\; \\mathrm{OR} \\;\\; a = b \\;\\; \\mathrm{OR}\\;\\; a > b.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In geometrical terms, these ordering relations exist because the real numbers reside along a one-dimensional line.  By contrast, complex numbers don't reside along a line, but within a [two-dimensional plane](complex_plane).  Therefore, it is nonsensical to write something like $z_1 < z_2$, where $z_1$ and $z_2$ are complex numbers.  (However, it is valid to write $|z_1| < |z_2|$, since magnitudes are real.)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, complex numbers possess a very important feature that real numbers lack: they are *algebraically closed*. This means that every complex polynomial equation has solution(s) in $\\mathbb{C}$.  The set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$, lacks this property: there are certain real algebraic equations we can write down, like $x^2 + 1 = 0$, which have no solution in $\\mathbb{R}$.  The \"closure\" property of $\\mathbb{C}$ is so important that it's called the [Fundamental Theorem of Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra).  This theorem implies that $\\mathbb{C}$ cannot be generalized to a more complicated number system in the same way we extended $\\mathbb{R}$ into $\\mathbb{C}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There do exist number systems more complicated than the complex numbers, which are formulated by discarding one or more of the rules of algebra.  The [quaternions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion) are a number system where each quaternionic number has four real components. Quaternions obey a non-commutative algebra where, generally, $ab \\ne ba$.  The [octonions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octonion) are an even more complicated number system; they have eight components, and are both non-commutative and non-associative, so that generally $(ab)c \\ne a(bc)$.  These and other still-more-complicated number systems have some applications in physics and other fields, but are overall much less important than $\\mathbb{C}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One big reason that complex numbers are so important and useful, compared to the quaternions and octonions, is that it's easy to formulate a version of calculus for them (i.e., complex derivatives and complex integrals).  The study of smooth complex functions, and their derivatives and integrals, is called **complex analysis**, and is a subject that we will [discuss extensively in this course](06_complex_derivatives.ipynb).  By contrast, since quaternions and octonions are not commutative, the concept of \"derivative\" becomes tricky to define for these number systems, which makes it harder to formulate a useful calculus."
