On the right-hand side, we introduce a time-dependent driving force $f(t)$ (which acts alongside the pre-existing spring and damping forces).

    "### Green's function for the driven harmonic oscillator\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\left[\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} + 2 \\gamma \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\omega_0^2\\right] G(t, t') = \\delta(t-t').$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the **Green's function equation**.  The function $G(t,t')$, which depends on the two variables $t$ and $t'$, is called the **Green's function**.  Note that the differential operator on the left-hand side involves only derivatives in $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Green's function describes the motion of a damped harmonic oscillator which is subjected to a particular choice of driving force, which is an infinitesimally sharp \"pulse\" centered at $t = t'$.  This pulse is described by using a [delta function](09_fourier_transform.ipynb#delta_function):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(t) = m\\,\\delta(t-t').$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we care about the Green's function?  The reason is that as soon as $G(t,t')$ is known, we can easily produce a specific solution to the driven harmonic oscillator equation for *any* given driving force $f(t)$.  That solution has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t) = \\int^\\infty_{-\\infty} dt' \\; G(t,t') \\; \\frac{f(t')}{m}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To show mathematically that this is indeed a solution, plug it into the equation of motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\\left[\\frac{d^2}{dt^2} + 2 \\gamma \\frac{d}{dt} + \\omega_0^2\\right]\\, x(t) &= \\int^\\infty_{-\\infty} dt' \\; \\left[\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} + 2 \\gamma \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\omega_0^2\\right] G(t,t') \\frac{f(t')}{m} \\\\ &= \\int^\\infty_{-\\infty} dt' \\; \\delta(t-t')\\, \\frac{f(t')}{m} \\\\ &= \\frac{f(t)}{m}.\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that we can move the differential operator inside the integral over $t'$ because $t$ and $t'$ are independent variables.)  We have thus shown that the above expression for $x(t)$ satisfies the driven oscillator equation for driving force $f(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Green's function concept is based on the principle of superposition of waves and oscillations.  The motion of the oscillator is induced by the driving force, but the value of $x(t)$ at time $t$ does not just depend on the instantaneous value of $f(t)$ at time $t$, but rather on the values of $f(t')$ over all times $t' < t$. (Indeed, the oscillations will continue even after the driving force is turned off.) The key idea is that any function $f(t)$ can be decomposed into a superposition of [delta functions](09_fourier_transform.ipynb#delta_function).  Since the response of the oscillator to a delta function force is given by the Green's function, the solution $x(t)$ is given by a superposition of Green's functions."

For $t < t'$, [Jordan's lemma](08_contour_integration.ipynb#jordans_lemma) requires us to close the contour in the upper half-plane; this encloses neither pole, so the integral is zero.

    "### Features of the Green's function<a name=\"properties\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously noted, the time-domain Green's function has a physical meaning: it represents the motion of the oscillator in response to a force \"pulse\", $f(t) = m\\, \\delta(t-t')$. The basic features of the results obtained [in the previous section](#solution) match our intuition of what this motion should look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to notice is that the Green's function depends on $t$ and $t'$ only in the combination $t-t'$. In physical terms, it is easy to see why: the response of the oscillator to an infintesimally sharp force pulse should only depend on the time elapsed since the pulse. To take advantage of this property, we could re-define the frequency-domain Green's function as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dt \\; e^{i\\omega (t-t')}\\, G(t-t'),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which then obeys\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left[- \\omega^2 - 2i \\gamma\\omega + \\omega_0^2\\right] G(\\omega) = 1.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a little nicer to work with, because there isn't an extraneous $t'$ variable in the definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing to notice is how the Green's function behaves just before and after the pulse. Its value is zero for $t - t' < 0$ (i.e., prior to the application of the pulse). This feature is referred to as \"causality\", and we will discuss it in greater detail [in the next section](#causality). Moreover, there is no discontinuity in $x(t)$ at $t - t' = 0$, which means that the force pulse does not cause the oscillator to \"teleport\" instantaneously to a different position.  Rather, it produces a discontinuity in the oscillator's *velocity*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see this explicitly, let us integrate the Green's function equation over an infinitesimal interval of time surrounding $t'$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\\lim_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0} \\int_{t'-\\epsilon}^{t'+\\epsilon} dt \\left[\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial t^2} + 2\\gamma\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\omega_0^2\\right] G(t,t') &= \\lim_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0} \\int_{t'-\\epsilon}^{t'+\\epsilon} dt \\; \\delta(t-t') \\\\ = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0} \\left\\{ \\left.\\frac{\\partial G(t,t')}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t = t' +\\epsilon} - \\left.\\frac{\\partial G(t,t')}{\\partial t}\\right|_{t = t' - \\epsilon}\\right\\} &= 1\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "On the last line, the expression on the left-hand side represents the difference between the oscillator velocity just after the pulse, and the velocity just before the pulse. Evidently, the force pulse imparts one unit of velocity at $t=t'$.  If you look at the solutions obtained [in the previous section](#solution), you can verify that indeed $\\partial G/\\partial t = 0$ immediately before the pulse, and $\\partial G/\\partial t = 1$ immediately after the pulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $t - t' > 0$, the applied force goes back to zero, and the system behaves like the undriven harmonic oscillator.  If the oscillator is under-damped ($\\gamma < \\omega_0$), it undergoes oscillation around the origin, which decays exponentially back to the origin as the energy imparted by the pulse is damped away.  If the oscillator is over-damped ($\\gamma > \\omega_0$), the oscillator moves for a distance, then decays exponentially back to the origin without oscillating."

    "### Causality<a name=\"causality\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "We have noted that the motion $x(t)$ ought to depend on the driving force $f(t')$ at all past times $t' < t$, but should *not* depend on the force at future times.  Because of the relation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty dt'\\; G(t,t')\\, \\frac{f(t')}{m},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "this means that the Green's function ought to satisfy\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G(t,t') = 0 \\;\\; \\mathrm{for}\\;\\; t -t' < 0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This condition is referred to as **causality**, because it is equivalent to saying that *cause* must precede *effect*.  A Green's function that satisfies it is called a **causal Green's function**.  The specific solution for $G(t,t')$ which we [derived earlier](#solution) is a causal Green's function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time-domain Green's function satisfies a second-order differential equation, so it has a family of solutions; the general solution contains two free parameters.  Not all solutions for the time-domain Green's function are causal.  We need to ask ourselves whether the specific solution we found in the previous section is the *only* possible causal solution.  It turns out that the answer is yes, and there are a couple of ways to see why.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach is to observe that for $t > t'$, the Green's function satisfies the differential equation for the *undriven* harmonic oscillator. [But as we have noted](#properties), the Green's function must also obey two conditions at $t = t' + 0^+$: (i) $G = 0$, and (ii) $\\partial G / \\partial t = 1$. These act as two boundary conditions for the undriven harmonic oscillator equation over the range $t > t'$.  Hence, the solution for $G(t,t')$ in this range is completely specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other way to see that the causal Green's function is unique is to imagine adding to our specific solution any solution $x_1(t)$ for the undriven harmonic oscillator.  It is easy to verify that the new form of $G(t,t')$ is still a solution to the differential equation for the Green's function.  As we saw [during our study of the damped harmonic oscillator](04_complex_oscillations.ipynb), the general solution for $x_1(t)$ contains two free parameters.  The general solution is always infinite for $t \\rightarrow -\\infty$, with one exception: the \"trivial\" solution $x_1(t) = 0$.  The trivial solution is a *specific* solution.  Thus, the causality requirement is equivalent to setting *two* boundary conditions, so the causal Green's function that we have found is the only possible one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, if we add a non-trivial undriven oscillator solution $x_1(t)$ to the Green's function, the Green's function would no longer have a [convergent Fourier transform](09_fourier_transform.ipynb#fourier_transform)&mdash;it wouldn't be square-integrable due to blowing up in the $t \\rightarrow -\\infty$ limit.  Hence, requiring the time-domain Green's function to obey causality is equivalent to requiring the frequency-domain Green's function to be well-defined."

This is a vast topic whose details are covered in advanced courses in theoretical physics and electrical engineering. Here, we give a brief sketch of some future directions of study.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have focused our attentions on the simplest case of an infinite one-dimensional uniform medium.

On the right-hand side of this equation is the [three-dimensional delta function](09_fourier_transform.ipynb#multidim), which describes a point source located at position $\\vec{r}'$ in the three-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "When $n = 1$, the above equation is similar to the frequency-domain Green's function equation [that we studied above](#outgoing_1d), except that the problem is three-dimensional rather than one-dimensional. Again assuming [outgoing boundary conditions](#outgoing_1d), the solution for the Green's function in three dimensions can be determined analytically. We will not cover the solution method, but the result turns out to be\n",

    "Similar to the [solution in one dimension](#outgoing_1d), this depends on the distance from the source, $|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|$, and thence describes waves that are emitted isotropically from the source at $\\vec{r}'$. One difference is that the magnitude of $G$ now decreases to zero with distance, due to the $|\\vec{r}-\\vec{r}'|$ in the denominator. This matches our everyday experience that the sound emitted from a point source grows fainter with distance, and it happens because the energy carried by the outgoing wave is spread out over a larger area with increasing distance from the source. By contrast, in one-dimensional space, the emitted waves do not spread as they travel, and hence $G$ does not decrease with distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When $n(\\vec{r})$ is not a constant but varies with position $\\vec{r}$, then the waves emitted by the source do not radiate outwards in a simple way. The variations in the refractive index cause the waves to scatter in complicated ways. In most situations, the exact solution for the Green's function cannot be obtained analytically, but must be computed using specialized numerical methods. If the variations in $n(\\vec{r})$ are sufficiently weak, one can sometimes derive approximate expressions for the Green's function, using a family of techniques known as \"perturbation theory\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For electromagnetic waves, there is another important complication: electromagnetic fields are described by vectors (i.e., the electric field vector and the magnetic field vector), not scalars.  The propagation of electromagnetic waves is therefore described by a vectorial wave equation, not the scalar wave equation that we have assumed so far. Moreover, electromagnetic waves are not generated by scalar sources, but by vector sources (electrical currents). The corresponding Green's function is not a scalar quantity, but something called a **dyadic Green's function**. This is a tensorial object that describes the *vector* waves emitted by a *vector* source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, even though we have dealt so far with classical (non-quantum) waves, the Green's function concept is also crucial to the theory of *quantum* waves. **Quantum field theory** describes how fields like the electromagnetic field behave according to the laws of quantum mechanics. In this theory, the Green's functions no longer have simple numerical values, but are quantum mechanical *operators*. Almost all problems in quantum field theory essentially involve calculating a quantum mechanical Green's function. Quantum field theory is widely used in the subjects of condensed-matter physics and high-energy particle physics."
