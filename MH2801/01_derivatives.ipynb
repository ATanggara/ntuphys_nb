    "\n",
    "Since derivatives are defined in terms of limit expressions, dealing with them requires some familiarity with **limit expressions**. Such mathematical expressions obey a few simple rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, the limit of a linear superposition is equal to a linear superposition of limits. This means that, given two constants $a_1$ and $a_2$ and two functions $f_1$ and $f_2$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} \\big[a_1 \\,f_1(x) \\;+\\; a_2\\, f_2(x)\\big] = a_1 \\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} f_1(x) \\;+\\; a_2 \\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} f_2(x).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, limits obey a product rule and a quotient rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} \\big[\\;f_1(x) \\; f_2(x)\\;\\big] &= \\Big[\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} f_1(x)\\Big]\\;\\Big[\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} f_2(x)\\Big]  \\\\ \\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} \\left[\\;\\frac{f_1(x)}{f_2(x)}\\;\\right] &= \\frac{\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} f_1(x)}{\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c} f_2(x)}. \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a special exception, the product rule and quotient rule should be ignored whenever they produce results of $0 \\times \\infty$, $\\infty/\\infty$, or $0/0$, since such combinations are undefined.  For instance, naively applying the product rule to each of the following three limit expressions gives $0 \\times \\infty$, but their actual values are finite, zero, and infinity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0}\\Big[\\;x\\,\\,\\;\\frac{1}{x}\\;\\Big] &= 1 \\\\ \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0}\\Big[\\,x^2\\;\\frac{1}{x}\\;\\Big] &= 0 \\\\ \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0}\\Big[\\,x\\;\\frac{1}{x^2}\\;\\Big] &= \\infty.\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often convenient to use the computer to check for the correctness of a limit expression. This can be done by setting quantities that are supposed to be infinitesimal to some small but nonzero value (note that this value has to be much smaller than any other numbers appearing in the code).  For example, here is a quick way to check that the derivative of $x^2 + 1$ is $2x$:"
