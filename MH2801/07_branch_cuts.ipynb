Taking this fact into account, we can re-write the above equation more carefully as\n",

In such cases, \"raising to the power of $p$\" is a **multi-valued operation**.

Since the real exponential is a one-to-one function, it has a well-defined inverse which is also a one-to-one function.\n",

    "The branch cut serves as a kind of boundary where the two branches are \"glued\" together. You can think of \"crossing\" a branch cut as having the effect of moving continuously from one branch to another. In the above figure, consider the case where $\\mathrm{arg}(z) = 0.02$, just above the branch cut.  Observe that $f_+(z)$ lies just above the positive real axis, and $f_-(z)$ lies just below the negative real axis.  Next, change the argument to $\\mathrm{arg}(z) = 6.26$, so that $z$ lies just below the branch cut.  This is equivalent to a small downwards displacement of $z$, \"crossing\" the branch cut.  Now, observe that $f_-(z)$ lies just below the positive real axis, close to where $f_+(z)$ was previously.  Conversely, $f_+(z)$ now lies just above the negative real axis, close to where $f_-(z)$ was previously.  In other words, crossing the branch cut had the effect of moving one value from the positive branch to the negative branch, and moving the other value from the negative branch to the positive branch.\n",

    "The figure below provides another way to visualize the role of the branch cut.  In this three-dimensional plot, the horizontal ($x$ and $y$) axes correspond to the complex plane.  The vertical axis shows the arguments for the two values of the complex square root, $f_+(z)$ and $f_-(z)$.  The argument of $f_+(z)$ is plotted in orange, and the argument of $f_-(z)$ is plotted in blue. As you vary the choice of the branch cut, observe that this affects which values of the multi-valued operation are assigned to the $+$ (orange) branch, and which values are assigned to the $-$ (blue) branch.  This emphasizes that the choice of branch cut simply represents a choice of how to divide up the branches of a multi-valued operation\\."
