{\large \textbf{Appendix A: Partial Wave Analysis}}
\end{center}

In this Appendix, we describe the method of \textbf{partial wave
  analysis}, which can be used to solve a specific but important class
of 3D scattering problems: those featuring a \textit{spherically
  symmetric} scattering potential, $V(r)$, which depends only on the
radial distance $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}$ and not on direction.
This typically describes a situation where a point particle or
spherically-symmetric object sits at the coordinate origin,
$\mathbf{r} = 0$, and is bombarded by incident particles.

\section{Spherical waves}
\label{sec:spherical}

We begin by considering ``exterior'' solutions to the Schr\"odinger
wave equation.  Far away from the scatterer, where $V(r) \rightarrow
0$, the Schr\"odinger wave equation can be rearranged into
$$\Big(\nabla^2 + k^2\Big) \psi(\mathbf{r}) = 0,\;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;k = \sqrt{2mE/\hbar^2},$$
which is called the \textbf{Helmholtz equation}.  We emphasize that
$E$ is to be treated as a tunable parameter in the differential
equation, not as an eigenvalue in an eigenproblem.  For the moment, we
will not specify the boundary conditions, and look instead for a
general set of solutions for a given $E$ (and hence $k$).

In spherical coordinates $(r,\theta,\phi)$, the Helmholtz equation can
be written explicitly as
$$\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial\theta}\right)+\frac{1}{r^2\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial\phi^2} + k^2\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = 0.$$

There is a standard procedure for solving this partial differential
equation.  We will merely summarize the key steps here; the
mathematical details can be looked up elsewhere.  The first step is to
perform a separation of variables, and look for solutions of the
form
$$\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = A(r) Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi),$$
where $A(r)$ is a function to be determined and $Y_{\ell
  m}(\theta,\phi)$ is a special function known as a
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics}{spherical
  harmonic}.  Spherical harmonics are functions designed specifically
to represent the angular dependence of solutions with definite angular
momenta.  In the context of quantum mechanics, $\ell$ and $m$ are the
quantum numbers representing the total angular momentum and the
$z$-component of the angular momentum.  It can be shown that the
indices $\ell$ and $m$ must be integers satisfying $\ell \ge 0$ and
$-\ell\le m \le \ell$, in order for $Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi)$ to be
periodic in $\phi$ and regular at the poles of the spherical
coordinate system.  Once this form for $\psi(r,\theta\phi)$ is
substituted into the Helmholtz equation, it can be shown that the
radial factor $A(r)$ must satisfy the ordinary differential equation
$$\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dA}{dr}\right) + \Big[k^2r^2 - \ell(\ell+1)\Big] A(r) = 0, \;\;\;\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_0^+,$$
which is a variant of the Bessel equation.  Note that $A(r)$ thus
depends on $\ell$, but \textit{not} on $m$.

The above equation has two linearly independent real solutions,
$j_\ell(kr)$ and $y_\ell(kr)$, which are called \textbf{spherical
  Bessel functions}.  Most scientific computing packages provide
functions to calculate these; Scientific Python, for example, has
\href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.spherical_jn.html}{\texttt{scipy.special.spherical\_jn}}
and
\href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.spherical_yn.html}{\texttt{scipy.special.spherical\_yn}}.
Various spherical Bessel functions are plotted below:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=0.63\textwidth]{spherical_bessel}
\end{center}

Note that the spherical Bessel functions of the second kind,
$y_\ell(kr)$, diverge at $kr\rightarrow 0$.  This does not bother us,
since we're interested in solutions defined in the exterior region,
away from the coordinate origin.

When the inputs are large, the spherical Bessel functions have the
limiting forms
$$\begin{aligned}j_\ell(kr)\; &\overset{kr\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} \; \frac{\sin(kr-\frac{\ell\pi}{2})}{kr} \\ y_\ell(kr)\; &\overset{kr\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} \; - \frac{\cos(kr-\frac{\ell\pi}{2})}{kr}.\end{aligned}$$
Since we are interested in incoming and outgoing spherical waves, it
is convenient to define
$$h_\ell^\pm(kr) = j_\ell(kr) \pm i y_\ell(kr).$$
This is called a \textbf{spherical Hankel function} of the first kind
($+$) or second kind ($-$).  It is a complex function that solves the
same differential equation, but has the limiting form
$$h_\ell^\pm(kr)\; \overset{kr\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} \; \pm \frac{\exp\left[\pm i(kr-\frac{\ell\pi}{2})\right]}{ikr}.$$
We can use this to write down a solution to the 2D Helmholtz equation,
$$\Psi_{\ell m}(\mathbf{r}) = h_{\ell}^\pm(kr) Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi),$$
which describes a spherical wave that is outgoing ($+$) or incoming
($-$), with a definite angular momentum described by quantum numbers
$\ell$ and $m$.

Because the Helmholtz equation is linear, any linear combination of
spherical waves, with various values of $(\ell,m)$, is also a solution:
$$\psi(\mathrm{r}) = \sum_\pm \sum_{\ell = 0}^\infty \sum_{m = - \ell}^\ell c_{\ell m}^\pm \Psi_{\ell m}(\mathbf{r}).$$
Moreover, it can be shown that the spherical waves form a complete
solution basis.  In other words, any solution to the 3D Helmholtz
equation within the exterior region can be written in the above form,
for some choice of complex coefficients $c_{\ell m}^\pm$.  Note, by
the way, that the spherical waves are appropriately normalized so that
the flux associated with each term is directly proportional to
$|c_{\ell m}^\pm|$.

\section{The scattering matrix}

For a given scattering problem, the exterior wavefunction is described
by the complex numbers $\{c_{\ell m}^+\}$ and $\{c_{\ell m}^-\}$.
These two sets of coefficients cannot, however, be independent of each
other.  For some fixed $V(\mathbf{r})$ and $E$, suppose there is an
incoming spherical wave with a specific angular momentum, say $c_{\ell
  m}^- = 1$ for some choice of $(\ell,m)$.  After being scattered, the
quantum particles must flow back out to infinity; the scattered
wavefunction can be described by a set of outgoing spherical wave
coefficients, $\{c_{\ell' m'}^+\;|\, \ell' \ge 0, \ell' \le m' \le
\ell'\}$.  We can repeat this for different values of incoming
$(\ell,m)$, each time getting another set of outgoing coefficients.

Since the Schr\"odinger wave equation is linear, the principle of
superposition states that linear combinations of scattering solutions
are also valid solutions---i.e., solutions to the same Schr\"odinger
wave equation, with the same $V(\mathbf{r})$ and $E$.  This implies
that if we supply an \textit{arbitrary} set of incoming coefficients
$\{c_{\ell m}^-\}$, the outgoing coefficients must be determined by a
linear relation of the form
$$c_{\ell m}^+ = \sum_{\ell'm'} S_{\ell m, \ell' m'} c_{\ell' m'}^-.$$
To make the notation a bit clearer, let us write this as
$$c_{\mu}^+ = \sum_{\nu} S_{\mu \nu} c_{\nu}^-.$$
Here, each $\mu$ or $\nu$ denotes a pair of angular momentum quantum
numbers $(\ell,m)$, and is called a \textbf{scattering channel}.  The
matrix $S$ is called a \textbf{scattering matrix}, and its components
$S_{\mu\nu}$ can be calculated from $V(\mathbf{r})$ and $E$.  Knowing
$S$, we can calculate the scattered wavefunction produced by any set
of incident waves.

There is an additional complication when the incident wave is a plane
wave of the form $\psi_i(\mathbf{r}) = \Psi_i \exp(i\mathbf{k}_i\cdot
\mathbf{r})$.  Relative to the coordinate origin, a plane wave is
neither purely ``incoming'' nor ``outgoing''.  There is a mathematical
identity which states that
$$e^{i\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}} = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell 2c^i_{\ell m}(\mathbf{k}_i) \, j_{\ell}(k_ir) \, Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi), \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\;c^i_{\ell m} = 2\pi e^{i\ell\pi/2} Y_{\ell m}^*(\hat{\mathbf{k}}_i).$$
Here, $\hat{\mathbf{k}}_i$ represents the angular components of the
incident wave-vector $\mathbf{k}_i$ in the spherical coordinate
system, while $k_i \equiv |\mathbf{k}_i|$.  In terms of
the spherical Hankel functions,
$$e^{i\mathbf{k}_i \cdot \mathbf{r}} = \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell \Big(c^i_{\ell m} h_{\ell}^+(k_ir) + c^i_{\ell m} h_{\ell}^-(k_ir) \Big) \, Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi).$$
In other words, the plane wave can be decomposed into a superposition
of incoming and outgoing spherical waves, with coefficients $c_{\ell
  m}^+ = c_{\ell m}^- = c^i_{\ell m}$.

As described in Chapter 1, the total wavefunction in a scattering
problem is the sum of the incident wavefunction $\psi_i(\mathrm{r})$
and the scattered wavefunction $\psi_s(\mathrm{r})$.  The latter must
be a superposition of outgoing spherical waves; let us denote the
coefficients by $c^s_{\ell m}$.  The scattering matrix relation can
thus be written as
$$c^+_\mu = c^i_{\mu} + c^s_{\mu} = \sum_{\mu\nu} S_{\mu\nu} c^i_{\mu} \;\;\; \Rightarrow \;\;\; c^s_{\mu} = \sum_{\mu\nu} \Big(S_{\mu\nu} - \delta_{\mu\nu}\Big) c^i_{\mu}.$$

\section{Spherically symmetric scattering potentials}

Generally, the scattering matrix needs to be calculated numerically.
The process is greatly simplified if the scattering potential is
spherically symmetric, i.e.~$V(\mathbf{r}) = V(r)$.  In that case,
angular momentum is conserved, so an incoming spherical wave with
angular momentum quantum numbers $(\ell,m)$ must scatter exclusively
into an outgoing spherical wave with the same $(\ell,m)$.  This means
that the scattering matrix is diagonal:
$$S_{\mu \nu} = s_\mu \delta_{\mu\nu}.$$

We can therefore solve for each scattering channel separately.  The
procedure is very similar to what we already went through in
Section~\ref{sec:spherical}.  The total wavefunction satisfies the
Schr\"odinger wave equation, which can be written in spherical
coordinates as
$$\frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2\sin\theta}\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\left(\sin\theta\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial\theta}\right)+\frac{1}{r^2\sin^2\theta}\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial\phi^2} + K^2(r) \psi(r,\theta,\phi) = 0,$$
where
$$K^2(r) = \sqrt{\frac{2m\big[E-V(r)\big]}{\hbar^2}}.$$
This is similar to the Helmholtz equation, but with the constant $k^2$
replaced by a function $K^2(r)$.  In each scattering channel, the
solution has the form
$$\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = A(r) \, Y_{\ell m}(\theta, \phi).$$
Upon substitution into the Schr\"odinger wave equation, we find that
$A(r)$ must satisfy
$$\frac{d}{dr}\left(r^2\frac{dA}{dr}\right) + \Big[K^2(r)\, r^2 - \ell(\ell+1)\Big] A(r) = 0, \;\;\;\ell \in \mathbb{Z}_0^+.$$
As before, the equation for $A(r)$ does not involve $m$; hence, the
scattering parameter $s_\mu \equiv s_{\ell m}$ does not depend on $m$,
and can be written as just $s_\ell$.  The second-order ordinary
differential equation can now be solved numerically by supplying two
boundary conditions at $r=0$, integrating up to a large value of $r$,
and matching to the exterior solution
$$A(r) \; \overset{r\rightarrow\infty}{\longrightarrow} \; c^-_\ell h^-_\ell(kr) + c^+_\ell h^+_\ell(kr) = c^-_\ell \Big(h^-_\ell(kr) + s_\ell h^+_\ell(kr)\Big).$$
The value of $s_\ell$ can then be extracted.  The remaining
implementation details for this solution method are left as an
exercise (see \hyperref[ex:numerical_spherical]{Exercise 1}).

The problem simplifies even further if we let the scattering potential
take the form of a finite spherical potential well of radius $R$:
$$V(r) = \begin{cases}-V_0 &\mathrm{for}\;\; r < R, \\ \;\;\; 0 & \mathrm{otherwise}.\end{cases}$$
For simplicity, let us assume that $V_0 > 0$, so that the potential is
attractive.  (The repulsive case has a few complications, involving
situations where $E < V(r)$; see
\hyperref[ex:spherical_barrier]{Exercise 2}.)  The Schr\"odinger wave
equation in the interior region now reduces to the Helmholtz equation,
but with $k$ replaced with
$$q = \sqrt{2m(E+V_0)/\hbar^2}.$$
The elementary solutions for $A(r)$ in the interior region are
$j_\ell(qr)$ and $y_\ell(qr)$.  However, we must exclude the latter,
since they diverge at $r = 0$.  (When we got to a similar point in
Section~\ref{sec:spherical}, we did not exclude the spherical Bessel
functions of the second kind, because at the time we were concerned
with exterior solutions defined away from the origin.)

Thus, we arrive at a solution of the form
$$A(r) = \begin{cases} \alpha_\ell\, j_\ell(qr), & r \le R \\ c^-_\ell \Big(h^-_\ell(kr) + s_\ell h^+_\ell(kr)\Big) & r \ge R.\end{cases}$$
So far, the values of $\alpha_\ell$, $c^-_\ell$, and $s_\ell$ remain
unknown.  To proceed, we match the wavefunction and its
derivative at the boundary $r = R$:
$$\begin{aligned} \alpha_\ell\, j_\ell(qR) &= c^-_\ell \Big(h^-_\ell(kR) + s_\ell h^+_\ell(kR)\Big) \\ \alpha_\ell\, q j_\ell'(qR) &= c^-_\ell k \Big({h^-_\ell}'(kR) + s_\ell {h^+_\ell}'(kR)\Big).\end{aligned}$$
Here, $j_\ell'$ denotes the derivative of the spherical Bessel
function, and likewise for ${h_\ell^\pm}'$.  Taking the ratio of these
two equations gives
$$\frac{q j_\ell'(qR)}{j_\ell(qR)} = k \frac{{h^-_\ell}'(kR) + s_\ell {h^+_\ell}'(kR)}{h^-_\ell(kR) + s_\ell h^+_\ell(kR)}.$$
With a bit of rearrangement, this becomes
$$s_\ell = - \frac{k{h_\ell^+}'(kR) j_\ell(qR) - qh_\ell^+(kR)j_\ell'(qR)}{k{h_\ell^-}'(kR) j_\ell(qR) - qh_\ell^-(kR)j_\ell'(qR)}.$$
The numerator and denominator are complex conjugates of one another,
since $j_\ell$ is real and $(h_\ell^+)^* = h_\ell^-$.  Hence, we
arrive at the result
$$s_\ell = - e^{i\delta_\ell}, \;\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\; \delta_\ell = 2\,\mathrm{arg}\!\left[k{h_\ell^+}'(kR) j_\ell(qR) - qh_\ell^+(kR)j_\ell'(qR)\right].$$
The scattering matrix component is a pure phase factor.  This is to be
expected, due to energy conservation.  Since the scattering matrix is
diagonal, the incoming flux and outgoing flux in each scattering
channel must be equal, so the only possible effect of the scattering
potential is to vary the phase of each outgoing spherical wave.

\textcolor{red}{[Numerical results]}

We can consolidate these results with the discussion from the previous
section.  For an incident plane wave with wave-vector $\mathbf{k}_i$,
the scattered wavefunction is
$$\begin{aligned}\psi_s(\mathbf{r}) &= \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell c_{\ell m}^s h_\ell^+(kr) \, Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi) \\ &= - 2\pi \sum_{\ell=0}^\infty (e^{i\delta_\ell} + 1) e^{i\ell\pi/2} h_\ell^+(kr) \sum_{m=-\ell}^\ell Y_{\ell m}^*(\hat{\mathbf{k}}_i) \, Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi). \end{aligned}$$
