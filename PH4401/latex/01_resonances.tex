\section{Bound states and extended states}

One of the most interesting features of wavefunctions in infinite
space is that they come in two distinct types: (i) \textbf{extended
  states}, which spread out over the entire space, and (ii)
\textbf{bound states}, which are localized in one region.  Both types
can co-exist in a single system.

The \textbf{1D finite square well} is a simple model which exhibits
both bound and extended states.  Consider the Hamiltonian
$$\hat{H} = \frac{\hat{p}^2}{2m} - V_0 \,\Theta(a -|\hat{x}|),$$ where
$\hat{x}$ and $\hat{p}$ are the 1D position and momentum operators,
$m$ is the particle mass, $V_0$ and $a$ are positive real parameters,
and $\Theta(\cdots)$ denotes the Heaviside step function (which is 1
if the input is positive, and 0 otherwise).  The potential describes a
square well of depth $V_0$ and width $2a$.  Inside the well region
($|x| < a$), the potential is $-V_0$; outside, it is zero.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{squarewell}
\end{figure}

We wish to solve the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for this
Hamiltonian.  In Appendix B, we describe a common numerical method,
known as the \textbf{transfer matrix method}, which can be used to
generate solutions for the square well and other similar 1D
potentials.  In this section, we not deal with the calculation
details, but instead zoom in on certain key facts.

The first thing to note is that when solving the Schr\"odinger wave
equation, it's necessary to specify the boundary conditions at
infinity.  This choice affects whether we get a bound state or
extended state.  The wavefunction of a bound state diminishes
exponentially as $x \rightarrow \pm\infty$; thus, in either external
region (i.e., $x < -a$ or $x > a$), it satisfies
$$-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\,\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2} = E \psi(x),$$
subject to the boundary conditions
$$\psi(x) \overset{x\rightarrow\pm\infty}{\sim} e^{\mp\kappa x}, \;\;\;\mathrm{Re}(\kappa) > 0.$$
The bound state solutions in the external regions therefore take the
form
$$\psi(x) = c_\pm\, e^{\mp\kappa x}, \;\;\mathrm{where}\;\, -\frac{\hbar^2\kappa^2}{2m} = E, \;\; c_\pm \in \mathbb{C}.$$
Since $E$ is real, it follows that $\kappa$ is real, and hence $E <
0$.  Moreover, the variational principle implies that $E \ge -V_0$.
Hence, bound state energies are restricted to the range $-V_0 \le E <
0$.  We can also show that the bound state energies are
\textit{discrete}: the energy spacing decreases with $a$, but so long
as $a$ is finite, the spacing is non-vanishing.  Another related
fact is that the wavefunction for a bound state can always be
normalized:
$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2\, dx\; =\; 1.$$
The normalization integral will not diverge, as $|\psi(x)|^2$ vanishes
exponentially as $x \rightarrow \pm \infty$.

For an extended state, the situation is quite different.  In this
case, the wavefunction does not vanish exponentially at infinity, but
instead takes the form
$$\psi(x) = \begin{cases} \alpha_-\, e^{ik x} + \beta_-\, e^{-ik x}, & \;\;\;x < -a\\ (\mathrm{something}) , & -a < x < a\\ \alpha_+\, e^{ik x} + \beta_+\, e^{-ik x} , & \;\;\,x > a.\end{cases}$$
Within each external region, $\psi(x)$ consists of a superposition of
left-moving and right-moving plane waves, with wavenumber $k$.  The
coefficients $\alpha_\pm$ and $\beta_\pm$ are not independent
quantities, but are linked by a linear relation (see Appendix B).  In
order to satisfy Schr\"odinger's equation, $k$ must satisfy
$$\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m} = E,$$
which means that extended states occur only for energies $E \ge 0$.
In fact, the solutions form a continuum, meaning we can find extended
states for \textit{every} $E \ge 0$.  Since $|\psi(x)|^2$ does not
diminish exponentially at infinity, the integral $\int_{-\infty}^\infty
|\psi(x)|^2\, dx$ is divergent.  Hence, the wavefunction
has no finite normalization.

The following figure shows numerically-obtained results for a square
well with $V_0 = 30$ and $a=1$ (in units where $\hbar = m =1$).  The
energy spectrum is shown on the left side.  There exist five bound
states; their plots of $|\psi|^2$ versus $x$ are shown on the right
side.  These results were computed using the transfer matrix code
described in Appendix B.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.81\textwidth]{boundvsextended}
\end{figure}

%% For $E \ge 0$, there is a continuum of extended states, which do not
%% have any finite normalization.  For $-V_0 < E < 0$, which is the
%% energy range ``inside'' the potential well, there exists a discrete
%% and finite set of bound states, whose wavefunctions vanish
%% exponentially outside the well and are therefore normalizable.

Many of the lessons drawn from this square well model can be
generalized to more complicated potential wells.  (Also, in cases
where the potential at infinity is $V_{\textrm{ext}}$ rather than
zero, extended states occur for $E \ge V_{\textrm{ext}}$ and bound
states occur for $\textrm{min}(V) < E < V_{\textrm{ext}}$.)

There are, however, two important provisos to bear in mind.  The first
is that if we vary the potential, the number of bound states can
change: i.e., bound state solutions can either appear or disappear.  A
numerical example is given below, showing the bound state energies for
the square well model with fixed $a = 1$ and varying well depth $V_0$:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{boundstate1d}
\end{figure}

For $V_0 = 30$, there are five bound states, but these disappear one
by one as we make the potential well shallower.  Note, however, that
one bound state survives in the limit $V_0 \rightarrow 0$.  There is a
theorem which states that any 1D attractive potential, no matter how
weak, always supports at least one bound state.  For details, see
\hyperref[ex:boundstate]{Exercise 1}.

In 3D, however, it is possible for an attractive potential to be ``too
weak'' to support a bound state.  Intuitively, this happens if the
zero-point energy of any prospective ground state exceeds the well
depth.  A numerical example is given below, for a uniform
spherically-symmetric well in 3D (the $l$'s label the angular momentum
quantum numbers).  For details, see
\hyperref[ex:boundstate3d]{Exercise 2}.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{boundstate3d}
\end{figure}

Another proviso to keep in mind is that in certain cases, it is
actually possible to have bound states with energy $E \ge 0$.  These
are called ``bound states in the continuum'', since they lie in the
same energy range as the continuum of extended states.  We will ignore
this phenomenon, since it happens only under special circumstances
that lie outside the scope of the present discussion.  The interested
reader may refer to the review by \hyperref[cite:hsu]{Hsu \textit{et
    al.}~(2016)}.

\section{Quasi-bound states and resonances}

For the 1D finite square well, bound states and extended states behave
very differently from each other.  In certain other models, however,
extended states can take on characteristics similar to bound states.
These are called \textbf{quasi-bound states}, and they play an
especially important role in scattering experiments.

An example of a potential function $V(x)$ that supports quasi-bound
states is shown below.  In the external regions, $|x| > b$, the
potential is zero.  Between $x = -b$ and $x = b$, sits a ``barrier''
of positive potential $V_1$.  Embedded in the middle of this barrier,
in the region $|x| < a$, is a central well of potential $V_0$ such
that $0 < V_0 < V_1$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{resonancewell}
\end{figure}

This potential is purely repulsive, so the discussion in the previous
section tells us there are no bound states, only extended states.

However, there's something intriguing about the energy range
corresponding to the central well, $V_0 < E < V_1$.  Consider a
slightly different situation, where the potential in the exterior
region is $V_1$ rather than $0$; i.e., the potential function is a
finite square well:
$$V_{\mathrm{alt}}(x) = \begin{cases}V_0, & |x| < a, \\ V_1, & \mathrm{otherwise}.\end{cases}$$
In this case, there will be bound states somewhere in the energy range
$V_0 < E < V_1$.  These bound states' wavefunctions diminish
exponentially away from the square well, and are thus close to zero
for $|x| > b$.  But since $V(x)$ and $V_{\mathrm{alt}}(x)$ differ from
each other only in the region $|x| > b$, these wavefunctions ought to
act as \textit{approximate} solutions to the Schr\"odinger wave
equation for the original potential function $V(x)$---which does not
support bound states!

Turning this argument around, we expect the potential function $V(x)$
to support certain extended states whose wavefunctions look very
similar to bound states, but aren't bound.

To find evidence of quasi-bound states, let us analyze the system
using the framework of a \textbf{scattering experiment}, as developed
in the previous chapter.  Let a particle be incident from the left,
with energy $E > 0$, described by the incident wavefunction
$$\psi_i(x) = \Psi_i \, e^{ik_i x}.$$
This gives rise to a scattered wavefunction $\psi_s(x)$, such that the
total wavefunction $\psi_i(x) + \psi_s(x)$ satisfies the Schr\"odinger
wave equation with energy $E$.  The scattered wavefunction must be
outgoing (see the previous chapter), so in the external region it
takes the form
$$\psi_s(x) = \Psi_i \times \begin{cases}f_- \,e^{-ik_ix}, & x \le -b \\ f_+ \,e^{ik_ix}, & x \ge b.\end{cases}$$
The scattering amplitudes $f_+$ and $f_-$ can be found by solving the
Schr\"odinger wave equation, using the transfer matrix method (see
Appendix B).  The figure below shows numerical results obtained for
$V_0 = 10,\,V_1 = 30,\,a=1$, and $b = 1.2$ or $b = 1.4$, with $\hbar =
m = 1$.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{resonances}
\end{figure}

The vertical axis shows $|f_+|^2$, which is called the
``transmittance'' and measures the probability for the incident
particle to pass through the potential.  The horizontal axis is the
particle energy $E$.  For $E < V_0$, the transmittance approaches
zero, and for $E \gtrsim V_1$, the transmittance approaches unity, as
expected.  Within the energy range $V_0 < E \lesssim V_1$, the
transmittance forms a series of narrow peaks, which get sharper for
larger $b$ (i.e., when the central well is more isolated from the
exterior space).  At the top of the figure, we have also plotted the
bound state energies for the square well potential $V'(x)$, which
closely matches the energies of the transmittance peaks (at least, the
first four peaks).

Upon examining the total wavefunction $\psi(x)$ at these special
energies, we see something very interesting.  The figure below plots
$|\psi(x)|^2$ versus $x$ at the energies corresponding to the first
three transmittance peaks, along with the bound state wavefunctions
for the corresponding square well.  We find that $|\psi(x)|^2$ is much
larger within the potential region than the exterior region.
Moreover, its profile is very similar to the corresponding square well
bound state.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{resonancewavefunctions}
\end{figure}

The enhancement of $|\psi(x)|^2$ is called a \textbf{resonance}.  It
happens because the system has a quasi-bound state---an extended state
that is very similar to a bound state.  When an incident particle
enters the scattering region, it can become temporarily trapped within
the potential well region, spending a long time ``bouncing around''
there before eventually escaping back to infinity.

This phenomenon is closely analogous to resonances occurring in
classical mechanics, which occur when we take a classical damped
harmonic oscillator and apply an oscillatory driving force.  When the
frequency of the driving force matches the natural frequency of the
oscillator, the system will oscillate with an extremely large
amplitude.  In the quantum mechanical context, the incident
wavefunction plays the role of a driving force, the incident particle
energy $E$ plays the role of the driving frequency, and the energy of
each quasi-bound state is like a natural frequency of oscillation.

Resonances play a critical role throughout experimental physics.
Experiments are often conducted for the express purpose of locating
and studying resonances.  When a resonance-induced scattering peak is
found, the location and shape of the peak can be used to deduce
various important features of the quasi-bound state, which often
provides a great deal of important information about the system
itself.

\section{Green's function analysis of scattering resonances}

Quasi-bound states and scattering resonances are not limited to 1D;
they are equally important, if not more so, in 2D and 3D systems.  The
Green's function, introduced in the previous chapter, provides a very
general method to study their properties.

Let $\hat{H} = \hat{T} + \hat{V}$ be the Hamiltonian of a system
supporting resonances, where $\hat{T}$ is the kinetic energy operator
and $\hat{V}$ is the potential operator.  We decompose the potential
into
$$\hat{V} = \hat{V}_0 + \hat{V}_1,$$
where $V_0$ describes a potential well and $V_1$ describes a potential
barrier.  An example of this decomposition is shown below, for the
1D potential function studied in the previous section.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{resonancewell_decomp}
\end{figure}

Let us assume that if the potential consisted of just $\hat{V}_0$
(i.e., the potential well without the barrier), the system has a
single bound state.  Denote this bound state by $|\varphi\rangle$, and
its energy by $E_0$.  Furthermore, let us denote the continuum of
extended states for the potential well by $\{|\psi_k\rangle\}$, with
energies $E_k$, where $k$ is a continuous index enumerating the
extended states.  The bound state and extended states satisfy the
Schr\"odinger equation
$$\begin{aligned}\big(\hat{T} + \hat{V}_0\big) |\varphi\rangle &= E_0 |\varphi\rangle \\ \big(\hat{T} + \hat{V}_0\big) |\psi_k\rangle &= E_k |\psi_k\rangle,
\end{aligned}$$
along with the orthogonality and completeness relations
$$\langle\varphi|\psi_k\rangle = 0, \quad |\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi| + \int dk\, |\psi_k\rangle\langle\psi_k| = \hat{I}.$$
As described in Section~VII of the previous chapter, the Green's
function for this system is
$$\hat{G}_0(E) = \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \Big(E - \hat{T} - \hat{V}_0 + i\varepsilon\Big)^{-1}.$$

Now, we introduce the barrier potential $\hat{V}_1$.  According to
Dyson's equations (see Section~VI of the previous chapter), the
Green's function for the full problem is
$$\hat{G} = \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G} \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0.$$
Our objective is to determine the matrix elements of $\hat{G}(E)$,
which can then be used to compute the scattering amplitudes at each
incident energy $E$.  The eigenstates of the potential well problem,
$|\varphi\rangle$ and $\{|\psi_k\rangle\}$, will be useful for this
purpose.  However, as usual when dealing with Dyson's equations, we
must watch out for the fact that $\hat{G}$ appears on both the left
and right hand sides.  This can be dealt with by judiciously inserting
a resolution of the identity:
$$\begin{aligned}\hat{G} &= \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G} \hat{I} \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0 \\ &= \hat{G}_0 + \hat{G} \left(|\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi| + \int dk\, |\psi_k\rangle\langle\psi_k|\right) \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0. \end{aligned}$$
We can now compute the matrix element
$\langle\varphi|\cdots|\varphi\rangle$ for both sides of this equation:
$$\begin{aligned}\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle = \langle\varphi|\hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle &+ \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle + \int dk\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle \\
\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \left(1 - \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle\right) &= \langle\varphi|\hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle + \int dk\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\varphi\rangle \\ \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+}
\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \left(1 - \frac{\langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle}{E - E_0 + i\varepsilon}\right) &= \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \frac{1}{E  - E_0 + i\varepsilon} \left(1+ \int dk\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle \right) \\
\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \Big(E - E_0 -\, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle \, & + i\varepsilon\Big) - \int dk\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle = 1.\end{aligned}$$
Similarly, computing the matrix element
$\langle\varphi|\cdots|\psi_k\rangle$ gives:
$$\begin{aligned}
\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle &= \langle\varphi|\hat{G}_0|\psi_k\rangle + \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\psi_k\rangle + \int dk\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1 \hat{G}_0|\psi_k\rangle \\
&= \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \left(E-E_k+i\varepsilon\right)^{-1} \left(\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\psi_k\rangle + \int dk\, \langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\psi_k\rangle\right)\end{aligned}$$
Note that the equations thus far have been exact (we have \textit{not}
used perturbation theory).  At this point, however, we apply an
approximation: in the last line of the above equation, let the factor
of $\langle\varphi|G|\varphi\rangle$ be large, so that the first term
in the sum becomes dominant over the second term.  It will be shown
below that $\langle\varphi|G|\varphi\rangle$ being large is precisely
the resonance condition, so this approximation will be a
self-consistent one.

With this approximation,
$$\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\psi_k\rangle \approx \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \frac{\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\psi_k\rangle}{E-E_k+i\varepsilon}.$$
Combining this with the other equation gives
$$\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \left[\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle \left(E - E_0 -\, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle \, + i\varepsilon\right) - \int dk\, \frac{\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\psi_k\rangle}{E-E_k+i\varepsilon} \, \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle\right] \approx 1.$$
Hence,
$$\boxed{\begin{aligned}\langle\varphi|\,\hat{G}(E)\,|\varphi\rangle \approx \frac{1}{\displaystyle E - E_0 - \langle\varphi|V_1|\varphi\rangle - \Sigma(E)} \qquad \\ \quad \mathrm{where}\;\;\Sigma(E) \equiv \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow0^+} \int dk\, \frac{\displaystyle\langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\psi_k\rangle \langle\psi_k| \hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle}{\displaystyle E-E_k+i\varepsilon}. \qquad
\end{aligned}}$$
The quantity $\Sigma(E)$ is called the \textbf{self-energy}, and we
will have much more to say about it shortly.  It is dependent on $E$,
but let us assume for now that the dependence is weak, so that
$\Sigma$ can be effectively treated as a constant.  It is
complex-valued, and both its real and imaginary parts will be
important.  (We will later show that $\mathrm{Im}(\Sigma) < 0$.)

The above result is extremely meaningful.  It tells us that
$\langle\varphi|\hat{G}(E)|\varphi\rangle$ is large when the
denominator is as close to zero as possible, which is called the
\textbf{resonance condition} (and is self-consistent with the
approximation that we made in the above derivation).  As we vary the
incident energy $E$ (over real values), the resonance condition is
satisfied when
$$E \;\approx\; E_{\mathrm{res}} \,\equiv\, E_0 + \langle\varphi|\hat{V}_1|\varphi\rangle + \mathrm{Re}\big[\,\Sigma\,\big].$$
We call $E_{\mathrm{res}}$ the \textbf{resonance energy}.  Its first
term is the energy of the bound state in the absence of the barrier
potential $\hat{V}_1$, and the second term describes the energy shift
induced by $\hat{V}_1$.  The third term is equal to the real part of
the self-energy $\Sigma$, and has a more subtle meaning: since the
definition of $\Sigma$ involves $\{|\psi_k\rangle\}$, we can think of
this term as an energy shift induced by the presence of the continuum
of extended states.

In Section VIII of the previous chapter, we derived the following
relationship between the Green's function and the scattering amplitude
$f$:
$$f(\mathbf{k}\rightarrow\mathbf{k}') \;\propto\; \langle \mathbf{k}'|\hat{V}|\mathbf{k}\rangle + \langle \mathbf{k}'|\hat{V}\hat{G}\hat{V}|\mathbf{k}\rangle.$$
Here, $|\mathbf{k}\rangle$ and $|\mathbf{k}'\rangle$ are incident and
scattered plane-wave states satisfying $|\mathbf{k}|=|\mathbf{k}'|$.
The first term describes the lowest-order scattering process (the
first Born approximation).  The second term contains all the
higher-order scattering processes, including resonant scenarios where
the particle ``bounces around'' inside the potential before escaping.
By inserting resolutions of the identity between each $\hat{V}$ and
$\hat{G}$ operator in the second term, we find that one of the terms
contributing to $f$ has the form
$$\Delta f(\mathbf{k}\rightarrow\mathbf{k}') \;\propto\; \langle \mathbf{k}'|\hat{V}|\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi|\hat{G}|\varphi\rangle\langle\varphi|\hat{V}|\mathbf{k}\rangle \;=\; \frac{\langle \mathbf{k}'|\hat{V}|\varphi\rangle \, \langle\varphi|\hat{V}|\mathbf{k}\rangle}{\displaystyle E - E_{\mathrm{res}} - i \mathrm{Im}[\,\Sigma\,]}.$$
This can become the dominant contribution to the scattering amplitude
if the resonance condition is satisfied.  The energy dependence of
$\Delta f$ is now determined by its denominator, and has a
characteristic behavior summarized in the figure below:

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{resonance}
\end{figure}

The graph of $|\Delta f|^2$ versus $E$ has a peaked shape known as a
\textbf{Lorentzian}.  The peak is centered at $E = E_{\mathrm{res}}$,
where the resonance condition is satisfied.  The width of the peak (as
measured by the ``full-width at half-maximum'') is $\delta E \sim
2|\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]|$.  In other words, the smaller the imaginary
part of the self-energy, the sharper the peak.

The phase, $\mathrm{arg}[\Delta f]$, also contains useful information.
As $E$ crosses $E_{\mathrm{res}}$ from below, the phase increases by
$\pi$.  The energy range over which this phase shift occurs is $\sim
|\mathrm{Im}[\Sigma]|$.

These two resonance signatures---peaks and phase shifts---are sought
after in numerous real-world scattering experiments.  In real
experiments, the peaks and phase shifts are often overlaid on a
``background'' caused by non-resonant effects.  As an example, the
plot below was released by the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC), showing a resonance peak on a large background.  This
was part of the experimental evidence that led to the LHC's discovery
of a new particle, the Higgs boson, in 2012.

\section{Fermi's Golden Rule}


\section*{Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Existence of bound states in 1D
\label{ex:boundstate}

\item In this problem, you will investigate the existence of bound
  states in a 3D potential well that is finite, uniform, and
  spherically-symmetric.  The potential function is
$$V(r,\theta,\phi) = -V_0\Theta(a-r),$$
  where $a$ is the radius of the spherical well, $V_0$ is the depth,
  and $(r,\theta,\phi)$ are spherical coordinates defined in the usual
  way.

  The solution involves a variant of the partial wave analysis
  discussed in Appendix A.  For $E < 0$, the Schr\"odinger equation
  reduces to
$$\begin{cases}\Big(\nabla^2 + q^2\Big) \psi(r,\theta,\phi) = 0 \;\;\mathrm{where}\;\; q = \sqrt{2m(E+V_0)/\hbar^2}, \;\;&\mathrm{for} \; r \le a \\ \Big(\nabla^2 - \gamma^2\Big) \psi(r,\theta,\phi) = 0 \;\;\mathrm{where}\;\; \gamma = \sqrt{-2mE/\hbar^2}, \;\;&\mathrm{for} \; r \ge a. \end{cases}$$
  For the first equation (called the Helmholtz equation), we seek
  solutions of the form
  $$\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = f(r) \, Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi),$$
  where $Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi)$ are
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_harmonics}{spherical
    harmonics}, and the integers $l$ and $m$ are angular momentum
  quantum numbers satisfying $l \ge 0$ and $-l \le m \le l$.
  Substituting into the Helmholtz equation yields
  $$r^2\frac{d^2f}{dr^2} + 2r \frac{df}{dr}+\left[q^2r^2-l(l+1)\right] f(r) = 0,$$
  which is the \textbf{spherical Bessel equation}.  The solutions to
  this equation that are non-divergent at $r = 0$ are $f(r) =
  j_\ell(qr)$, where $j_\ell$ is called a \textbf{spherical Bessel function
    of the first kind}.  Most numerical packages provide functions to
  calculate these (e.g.,
  \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.spherical_jn.html}{\texttt{scipy.special.spherical\_jn}}
  in Scientific Python).

  Similarly, solutions for the second equation can be written as
  $\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = g(r) \, Y_{\ell m}(\theta,\phi),$ yielding an
  equation for $g(r)$ called the \textbf{modified spherical Bessel
    equation}.  The solutions which do not diverge as $r\rightarrow
  \infty$ are $g(r) = k_\ell(\gamma r)$, where $k_\ell$ is called a
  \textbf{modified spherical Bessel function of the second kind}.
  Again, this can be computed numerically (e.g., using
  \href{https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.special.spherical_kn.html#scipy.special.spherical_kn}{\texttt{scipy.special.spherical\_kn}}
  in Scientific Python).

  Using the above facts, show that the condition for a bound state to
  exist is
  $$\frac{qj_\ell'(qa)}{j_\ell(qa)} = \frac{\gamma k_\ell'(\gamma a)}{k_\ell(\gamma a)},$$
  where $j_\ell'$ and $k_\ell'$ denote the derivatives of the relevant
  special functions, and $q$ and $\gamma$ depend on $E$ and $V_0$ as
  described above.  Write a program to search for the bound state
  energies at any given $a$ and $V_0$, and hence determine the
  conditions under which the potential does not support bound
  states.

%% For decades after the discovery of quantum mechanics, the quantum
%% double-slit experiment was just a ``thought experiment'', meant to
%% illustrate the features of quantum mechanics that had been uncovered
%% by other, more complicated experiments.  Nowadays, the most convenient
%% way to do the experiment is with light, using single-photon sources
%% and single-photon detectors.  Quantum interference has also been
%% demonstrated experimentally using electrons, neutrons, and even
%% large-scale particles such as buckyballs.
