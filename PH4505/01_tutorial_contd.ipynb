    "In the [first part of the tutorial](00_tutorial.ipynb), we worked through a Scipy program that [computes the electrostatic potential of a set of charged particles](00_tutorial.ipynb#electrostatics).  At the time, we did not explain much about the data structures there were used in the program for storing numerical information (such as the values of the potential at different points).\n",

All three types of data structure are used to store linear sequences of data, similar to the concept of \"vectors\" in physics and mathematics. However, these data types have slightly different properties, which you need to be aware of."

    "As usual, the first line is used to [import the Scipy module](00_tutorial.ipynb#import) (we need to do this to make use of array data structures). On the second line, we call <code>[linspace](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html)</code> to generate an array of 9 numbers, equally-spaced between -0.5 and 0.5 (inclusive).  On the third line, we call the built-in Python function <code>[print](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings)</code> to output some information in textual format (rather than outputting a graph, as we've been doing so far).  In this case, we are using <code>print</code> to examine <code>x</code>, and specifically (i) the object type of <code>x</code>, and (ii) the value of <code>x</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The array data structure is provided specifically by the Scipy module, and it has special features that are geared towards scientific computing.  Unlike the other types of data structures that we'll describe later, arrays can only contain numbers (furthermore, each array can only contain numbers of one type, e.g. integers or complex numbers; we'll discuss this issue [later](02_numerical_data.ipynb)). Arrays also support special facilities for doing numerical linear algebra, which we'll also discuss later.\n",

If you ever need to revise this size, you have to create a *new* array and transfer the contents over from the old array.  (However, the value of individual numbers stored in the array can be freely altered.)\n",

For instance, we have encountered the <code>[len](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len)</code> function, which accepts an array input and returns the array's length.  We have also encountered the <code>[abs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#abs)</code> function, which accepts an array input and returns a new array whose contents are the absolute values of the input array.

Unlike arrays, lists are built into the Python programming language itself, and are not specific to the Scipy module.  Lists are general-purpose data structures which are ''not'' optimized for scientific computing (for example, we will need to use arrays, not lists, when we want to do linear algebra).\n",
    "\n",
    "The most convenient thing about Python lists is that you can specify them explicitly, using <code>[...]</code> notation.  For example, the following code creates a list named <code>u</code>, containing the integers 1, 1, 2, 3, and 5:\n",

    "This way of creating lists is also useful for creating Scipy arrays.  The [http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.array.html array] function accepts a list as an input, and returns an array containing the same elements as the input list.  For example, to create an array containing the numbers 0.2, 0.1, and 0.0:\n",
    "\n",
    " '''>>>''' x = array([0.2, 0.1, 0.0])\n",

    "\n",
    "Usually, we will do number crunching using arrays rather than lists.  However, sometimes it is useful to work directly with lists.  One convenient thing about lists is that they can contain arbitrary Python objects, of any data type; by contrast, arrays are allowed only to contain numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a Python list can store character strings:\n",
    "\n",
    " '''>>>''' u = [1, 2, 'abracadabra', 3]\n",

    "\n",
    "In the above example, <code>append</code>, <code>insert</code>, and <code>pop</code> are called '''methods'''.  You can think of a method as a special kind of function which is \"attached\" to an object and relies upon it in some way.  Just like a function, a method can accept inputs, and give a return value.  For example, when <code>u</code> is a list, the code\n",
    "\n",
    " z = u.pop(3)\n",
    "\n",
    "means to take the list <code>u</code>, find element index 3 (specified by the input to the method), remove it from the list, and return the removed list element.  In this case, the returned element is named <code>z</code>.  [https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists See here for a summary of Python list methods].  We'll see more examples of methods as we go along.\n",
    "\n",
    "=== Tuples ===\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from lists, Python provides another kind of data structure called a '''tuple'''.  Whereas lists can be constructed using square bracket <code>[...]</code> notation, tuples can be constructed using parenthetical <code>(...)</code> notation:\n",
    "\n",
    " '''>>>''' v = (1, 2, 'abracadabra', 3)\n",
    " '''>>>''' v\n",
    " (1, 2, 'abracadabra', 3)\n",

    "Like lists, tuples can contain any kind of data type.  But whereas the size of a list can be changed (using [[#Aside: about methods|methods]] like <code>append</code>, <code>insert</code>, and <code>pop</code>, as described in the [[#Lists|previous subsection]]), the size of a tuple is fixed once it's created, just like an [[#Arrays|array]].\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are mainly used as a convenient way to \"group\" or \"ungroup\" named variables.  Suppose we want to split the contents of <code>v</code> into four separate named variables.  We could do it like this:\n",

    " '''>>>''' dog\n",

    " '''>>>''' apple \n",
    " 'abracadabra'\n",
    " '''>>>''' banana\n",
    " 3\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left-hand side of the <code>=</code> sign, we're actually specifying a tuple of four variables, named <code>dog</code>, <code>cat</code>, <code>apple</code>, and <code>banana</code>. In cases like this, it is OK to omit the parentheses; when Python sees a group of variable names separated by commas, it automatically treats that group as a tuple.  Thus, the above line is equivalent to\n",

    "\n",
    "We have added an '''optional parameter''', specified as <code>radius=5e-2</code>.  An optional parameter is a parameter which has a default value.  In this case, the optional parameter is named <code>radius</code>, and its default value is <code>5e-2</code> (which means $5\\times10^{-2}$; you can also write it as <code>0.05</code>, which is equivalent).  If you call the function omitting the last input, the value will be assumed to be 0.05.  If you supply an explicit value for the last input, that overrides the default.\n",

    "\n",
    "=== Assert statements ===\n",
    "\n",
    "In the function body, we have added the following three lines:\n",

    "Similar to writing [[Scipy tutorial#Comments|comments]], adding <code>assert</code> statements to your program is good programming practice.  They are used to verify that the assumptions made by the rest of the code (e.g., that the <code>xc</code> and <code>qc</code> arrays have equal length) are indeed met.  This ensures that if we make a programming mistake (e.g., supplying arrays of incompatible size as inputs), the problem will surface as soon as possible, rather than letting the program continue to run and causing a more subtle error later on.\n",

To find the relevant indices, we make use of the following slicing feature: if a comparison expression  is supplied as an index, that refers to those indices for which the comparison is true.  In this case, the comparison expression is <code>abs(X-xc[j]) < radius</code>, which refers to the indices of $X$ which are below the minimum radius.

Instead, you can write another demo function, and revise that single top-level statement to call the new demo function instead.\n",

    "\n",
    "The first two arguments, as before, are the x and y coordinates for the plot.  The next argument, <code>'ro'</code>, specifies that we want to plot using red circles, rather than using lines with the default color.\n",

    "This way of specifying a function input, which has the form <code>FOO=BAR</code>, is something we have not previously seen.  It relies on a feature known as [http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-arguments '''keyword arguments'''].  In this case, <code>label</code> is the keyword (the name of the parameter we're specifying), and <code>fig_label</code> is the value (which is a string object; we'll discuss this below).  Keyword arguments allow the caller of a function to specify optional parameters in any order.  For example,\n",

    "\n",
    "On the right-hand side of the above statement, we build the contents of the string from several pieces.  This is done in order to get a different string for each value of <code>N</code>.  The <code>+</code> operator \"concatenates\" strings, joining the strings to its left and right into a longer string.  In this case, the string <code>fig_label</code> consists of the following shofter strings, concatenated together:\n",

The <code>ylim</code> function specifies the lower and upper limits of the plot's y-axis (there is a similar <code>xlim</code> function, which we didn't use).  The <code>plt.legend()</code> statement causes the curve label to be shown in a legend included in the plot.
